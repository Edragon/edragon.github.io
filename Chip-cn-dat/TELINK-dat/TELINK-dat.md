## TLSR8359


datasheet == [[PB_TLSR8359-E_Product Brief for Telink ULP 2.4GHz RF SoC TLSR8359.pdf]]


The TLSR8359 with internal Flash support is dedicated to 2.4GHz RF System-On-Chip solution, such as Retail/Logistics, Private network, Beacon applications, and etc. It supports 2.4GHz proprietary standard.

The TLSR8359 integrates a power-balanced 32-bit MCU, 2.4GHz Radio, 48kB/8kB SRAM, 512kB/64kB Flash, 14bit ADC
with PGA, PWM, one quadrature decoder (QDEC), flexible IO interfaces, and other peripheral blocks required for 2.4GHz
RF System-On-Chip application development. The TLSR8359 also includes multi-stage power management design
allowing ultra-low power operation and making it the ideal candidate for power-constraint applications.
