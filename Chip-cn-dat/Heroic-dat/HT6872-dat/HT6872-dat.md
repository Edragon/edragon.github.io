## HT6872-dat 

### Brief 
HT6872 is a low EMI, anti-cut top distortion, Mono Filter-Free Class D audio power amplifier. At 6.5V power supply, 10% THD + N, 4Ω load conditions, the output power of 4.7W, maintaining high efficiency in all types of audio applications and terminal provides Class AB amplifier performance.
<br />

HT6872 is the biggest characteristic anti-cut top distortion (ACF) output control function, can detect and suppress the output signal of the input music, speech signal amplitude caused by excessive cut top distortion (audio break), can adaptively prevent the battery application of output voltage drop caused by the power cut top, dramatically improves sound quality, create a very comfortable listening enjoyment, and to protect the speakers from overload damage. At the same chip has ACF-Off mode.
<br />

HT6872 has a unique electromagnetic radiation (EMI) suppression technology and superior performance of full-bandwidth low radiation, the radiation level in the design without the secondary is still far below the FCC Part15 Class B standard, not only to avoid any interference with other sensitive circuits further reduce system design difficulty.
<br />

HT6872 integrated filter-free digital modulation techniques, can directly drive the speaker and minimize distortion and noise pulse output signal. Without output filter network, very few external components to save space and cost of the system is ideal for portable applications.
<br />

In addition, HT6872 built-in shutdown feature allows minimize standby current, output over-current protection is also integrated, on-chip over-temperature protection and under-voltage protection function abnormalities.
