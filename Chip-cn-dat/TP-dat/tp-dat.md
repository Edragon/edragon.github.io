## TP4083

3mA-500mA Linear Li-ion Battery Charger with OVP == [[power-protection-dat]]

The TP4083 is a single-cell lithium battery charger with OVP (over-voltage protection), battery reverse polarity protection, and input power reverse polarity protection, all in a single chip. It supports a wide charging current range from 3mA to 500mA. Using trickle, constant current, and constant voltage control, the SOT23-6 or DFN2*2-6 package and minimal external components make the TP4083 an ideal choice for portable applications. The TP4083 is suitable for both USB power and adapter power sources.

The 16V over-voltage protection feature allows the chip to be used in applications requiring a wider and higher input voltage range. When the input voltage is between 6.5V and 16V, the chip can still provide some output current to charge the battery, reducing charging time. The chip’s thermal feedback automatically adjusts the charging current to limit the chip temperature during high-power operation or high ambient temperature conditions. When the battery reaches the preset voltage, the charging current drops to 1/10 of the set value, and the TP4083 will automatically terminate charging.

When the input voltage (AC adapter or USB power) is removed, the TP4083 automatically enters a low current state, with battery leakage current below 1μA. Other features of the TP4083 include power undervoltage lockout, automatic recharge, and two status pins for indicating charging completion and input voltage connection.
