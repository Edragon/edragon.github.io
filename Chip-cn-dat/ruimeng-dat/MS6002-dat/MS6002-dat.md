The MS6001/2/4 operational amplifiers feature ultra-low power consumption, rail-to-rail input and output, low input voltage, and low current noise.

Specifically, they can operate with a single power supply or dual power supply in the range of 1.8V to 5V. The low power consumption and low noise make the MS6001/2/4 suitable for portable devices, and the rail-to-rail input and output swing characteristics can be utilized by designers for buffering CMOS, ADCs, DACs, ASICs, or other systems requiring low power and wide output swing.
