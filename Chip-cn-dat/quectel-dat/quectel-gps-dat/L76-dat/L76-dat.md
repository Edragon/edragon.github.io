## standby mode 

Pulling STANDBY pin low will make the GNSS module enter Standby mode and releasing STANDBY pin which has been pulled high internally will make the modules back to Continuous mode. 
Note that pulling  down  STANDBY  pin  to  ground  will  cause  the  extra  current  consumption  which  makes  the typical Standby current reach to about 600 Î¼A @ VCC=3.3 V.

Sending corresponding command will make the modules enter Standby mode. Sending any data via UART will make the modules exit standby mode as UART is still accessible in Standby mode.
