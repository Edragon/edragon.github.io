## standby mode 

Pulling STANDBY pin low will make the GNSS module enter Standby mode and releasing STANDBY pin which has been pulled high internally will make the modules back to Continuous mode. 
Note that pulling  down  STANDBY  pin  to  ground  will  cause  the  extra  current  consumption  which  makes  the typical Standby current reach to about 600 Î¼A @ VCC=3.3 V.

Sending corresponding command will make the modules enter Standby mode. Sending any data via UART will make the modules exit standby mode as UART is still accessible in Standby mode.

## hardware 

1. There is no need to use an additional LNA for L76-L and L76-L(L) modules, because there isalready an embedded LNA inside these two modules.
2. The selected LNA should support both GPS and GLONASS system. For more information, pleasecontact Quectel technical supports.
3. The power consumption of the device can be reduced by controlling the LNA ENABLE pin throughthe ANTON pin of the modules. If ANTON function is not used, please connect the LNA ENABLEpin to VCC and keep LNA always on.
