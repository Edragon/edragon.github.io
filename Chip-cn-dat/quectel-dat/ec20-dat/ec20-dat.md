## About EC20 Modules

EC20 R2.0 is the recently launched Cat 4 LTE wireless communication module from Quectel. It adopts LTE 3GPP Rel.11 technology and supports a maximum downlink rate of 150Mbps and a maximum uplink rate of 50Mbps. It is also compatible with the UMTS/HSPA+ UC20 module in the package. And the long-distance communication multi-network standard LTE Cat 3 module enables seamless switching between 3G networks and 4G networks.

The EC20 R2.0 Series modules are available in EC20-C R2.0 and EC20-CE R2.0 versions, making them backward compatible with existing EDGE and GSM/GPRS networks to ensure remote locations in the absence of 3G and 4G networks Also works fine.

EC20 R2.0 has built-in multi-constellation high-precision positioning GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/BeiDou/Galileo/QZSS) receiver; while simplifying product design, it also greatly improves positioning speed and accuracy.

EC20 R2.0 has built-in rich network protocols, integrates multiple industry standard interfaces, and supports multiple drivers and software functions (USB for Windows XP/Windows Vista/Windows7/Windows 8/8.1/Windows 10/Linux/Android systems) Drivers, eCall*, etc.) have greatly expanded the scope of application of EC20 R2.0 in M2M, such as CPE, routers, data cards, tablets, car, security and industrial PDA.
