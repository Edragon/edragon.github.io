# A7670 DAT

- LTE-FDD / LTE-TDD

* Default baudrate is 115200




## Hardware Design 

### Power Supply 

When the module transmits at maximum power in LTE mode, the instantaneous peak current can reach up to 1A, resulting in a large voltage drop on VBAT. To ensure the voltage drop is less than 300mV, the external power supply must be capable of providing at least 1A.

When the power supply can provide a continuous current of 1A, the total capacitance of the external power supply capacitor is recommended to be no less than 200uF. If a continuous current of 1A cannot be provided, the total capacitance of the external capacitor is recommended to be no less than 600uF to ensure that the voltage drop on VBAT does not exceed 300mV at any time.
