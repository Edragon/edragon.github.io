ESP32-C3 Sleep and Low Power Mode Current Consumption

## 1. **Deep Sleep Mode**
- **Current Consumption:** ~5 µA
- **Key Features:**
  - Most of the chip is powered down.
  - RTC (Real-Time Clock) and ULP (Ultra-Low-Power) coprocessor can remain active for periodic wakeups.
  - Ideal for applications with infrequent activity (e.g., periodic sensor readings).

## 2. **Light Sleep Mode**
- **Current Consumption:** ~130 µA
- **Key Features:**
  - The CPU is paused, but the system RAM and peripherals remain powered.
  - Fast wake-up capability for applications needing frequent activity.
  - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can maintain connections in this mode.

## 3. **Modem Sleep Mode**
- **Current Consumption:**
  - **Wi-Fi active:** ~10 mA to 25 mA (varies with data traffic and configuration).
  - **Wi-Fi off:** ~2.7 mA
- **Key Features:**
  - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios can be turned off between data transmissions.
  - Useful for IoT applications requiring intermittent communication.

## 4. **Active Mode (Idle or Running)**
- **Current Consumption:**
  - **CPU Idle:** ~10 mA
  - **CPU Running:** ~70 mA to 100 mA (depending on clock speed and workload).

## Factors Affecting Current Consumption
- **Power Supply Voltage:** Lower voltage can slightly reduce power consumption.
- **Peripheral Use:** Activating GPIO, ADC, or other components increases current.
- **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Activity:** Radio transmissions significantly increase current.

## Optimizing Power Consumption
- Use **Deep Sleep** for long idle periods.
- Optimize wake-up intervals and duration.
- Turn off unused peripherals.
- Use **Modem Sleep** for connected but low-activity states.
