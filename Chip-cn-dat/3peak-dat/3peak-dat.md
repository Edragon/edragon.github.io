24-V Input, 180-mA Output High Voltage and Low Quiescent Current LDO

The TPL810 is a series of high-performance and lowdropout linear regulators. The TPL810 series supports a maximum 24-V input voltage and 180-mA output current with a low quiescent current and high PSRR. The TPL810 series is stable with a 2.2-μF to 22-μF output capacitor, and a 4.7-μF ceramic capacitor is recommended.
