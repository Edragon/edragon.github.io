## TP5532

The 3PEAK TP5531/5532/5534 is a series of low-power chopper-stabilized operational amplifiers that provide input offset voltage correction for low offset and offset drift over time and temperature. 

The series operates with a single supply voltage as low as 1.8 V, while drawing a quiescent current of 42 μA per amplifier with a gain bandwidth product of 350 kHz. 

The series is unity-gain stable, and has no 1/f noise. 

It also has a good power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and features the rail-to-rail input and output swing.
