## PMMA Drilling

**7 Key Tips to Prevent PMMA (Acrylic) Cracking During Drilling (Tested & Reliable)**

1. Place a Wooden Board Underneath the Sheet (Must Do)
   - This is the most important anti-crack tip.
   - Prevents the drill bit from tearing the PMMA when breaking through the bottom.
   - Provides support and reduces vibration.
   - Results in smooth hole edges without chipping.
   - 📌 No backing board → almost guaranteed to crack.

2. Use Medium Drill Speed (Not High, Not Too Low)
   - Recommended speed: **800–1500 rpm** (best)
   - High speed: melts, overheats, and cracks PMMA.
   - Low speed: stalls, doesn't cut, more vibration, also prone to cracking.
   - Medium speed + steady feed is safest.

3. Use a Sharp Drill Bit (Dull Bits = Source of Cracks)
   - Dull bits cause:
     - Friction and heat
     - "Squeezing" cracks instead of cutting
     - White holes, cracked edges
   - Solutions:
     - ✔ Use a new drill bit
     - ✔ Wood spade bits, plastic-specialized bits, or step bits are best

4. Apply Clear Tape Over the Drilling Area
   - Very useful trick:
     - Tape absorbs vibration
     - Reduces cracking probability
     - Protects hole edges from chipping
   - How to apply:
     - One layer on the front
     - One layer on the back (best)

5. Apply Steady, Even Downward Pressure
   - Too light → friction, heat, cracks
   - Too hard → jams, vibration, cracks
   - Correct method:
     - 👉 Press down smoothly and steadily, like shaving wood
     - 👉 Let the drill bit "bite" and produce chips (not powder or melted strands)

6. Use Soapy Water as a Coolant (Simple & Effective)
   - Do not use oil or alcohol.
   - Soapy water/dish soap water:
     - Cools
     - Reduces friction
     - Cleaner hole edges
     - Lowers cracking risk
   - Just a few drops are enough.

7. Drill Large Holes in Steps (Drilling Large Holes at Once = Cracks)
   - For example, to drill a 12mm hole:
     - Start with a 2–3 mm pilot hole
     - Then a 6–8 mm intermediate hole
     - Finish with the final hole (hole saw/step bit/large drill bit)
   - ⚠️ Drilling large holes in one go → 90% chance of cracking or chipping.
