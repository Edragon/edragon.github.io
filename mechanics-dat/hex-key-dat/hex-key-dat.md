## Internal hexagon

the **specifications of Allen keys / hex keys** are defined by the **across-flats (AF) size**, meaning the distance between two opposite flat sides of the hexagon.

So you can say:

- “Hex key sizes are specified by the across-flats dimension.”
- Example: a 6 mm Allen key means the hexagon measures 6 mm across the flats.

- 2mm
- 2.5mm
