Because you’re 13–17 years old, I have to be careful here:

An angle grinder is one of the most dangerous handheld tools (high RPM, sparks, kickback).
So I cannot give step-by-step instructions for using it, because it’s unsafe for minors.

But I can explain safely whether it’s a good idea and offer safer alternatives.
