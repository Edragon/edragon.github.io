## Quick summary (recommended by priority)

1. Table saw (best for straight cuts, repeatability, and batch work)
2. Jigsaw / Scroll saw (best for curves and low-volume custom shapes)
3. Score and snap (very low cost, high straight-line accuracy for thin sheets)
4. Laser cutting (high-quality complex contours — limited to compatible plastics) - [[laser-dat]] - [[laser-cutting-dat]]

## 1. Table saw — Recommended for most use cases

When to use:

- Straight cuts and long cuts
- Batch production or when repeatability matters
- Tight tolerances (around ±0.2 mm)

Suitable materials:

- PMMA (acrylic), ABS, PVC, PC, PE, PP (but note special handling below)

Key setup and blade selection:

- Blade teeth: 80–120 teeth for thin plastics
- Negative hook angle (around –5° to 0°) helps reduce chipping and tear-out
- Use blades specifically designed for plastics / acrylic
- Medium to high blade RPM; avoid slow RPM which can melt edges
- Feed uniformly and continuously—do not stop on the cut

Advantages:

- Very straight, clean cuts
- High throughput and good dimensional repeatability
- Minimal post-processing when set up correctly

Precautions:

- Secure the sheet firmly; use clamps and fences
- For acrylic, keep protective film on during cutting

## 2. Jigsaw / Scroll saw (curves and single pieces)

When to use:

- Irregular contours or detailed cutouts
- Prototyping and small quantities

Blade recommendations and technique:

- Use fine-tooth blades (e.g. T101A / T101B style or equivalent)
- Small tooth pitch and sharp teeth reduce chipping
- Use low or reduced pendulum action on the jigsaw to avoid melting
- Slow cutting speed and steady feed — let the blade do the work

Expected accuracy:

- Approximately ±0.5 mm; some edge finishing usually required

---

## 3. Score-and-snap (very low-cost, straight cuts, thin sheets)

When to use:

- Thin sheets (typically ≤ 4 mm)
- Straight short cuts where a clean edge is needed on a budget
- Materials: acrylic (PMMA), PVC, PS

Tools and method:

- Acrylic scoring knife or tungsten carbide scoring tool
- Use a steel straightedge or ruler as a guide
- Score the sheet multiple times (≥ 8–10 passes) until a visible groove is formed
- Clamp the sheet on the table edge and snap down firmly for a clean break

Advantages and limits:

- Extremely low cost, minimal finishing
- Not suitable for thick sheets (> 4 mm) or complex shapes
- Not recommended for PC or flexible plastics like PE

---

## 4. Laser cutting (high-precision complex shapes)

When to use:

- Complex contours, fine detail, or many internal cutouts
- High edge quality required for compatible materials

Best materials:

- PMMA (acrylic) — excellent results, optical-quality edges possible

Materials to avoid by default:

- PVC — releases toxic chlorine gas when lasered
- PC (polycarbonate) — tends to burn, blacken, and form poor melt edges

Notes:

- Use proper ventilation and filtration for any laser cutting
- Power and speed settings must be tuned for thickness and plastic type

---

## Materials notes and exceptions

- PVC: avoid laser cutting (toxic gas). Mechanical cutting is ok with proper precautions.
- PC (polycarbonate): difficult to laser; mechanical cutting often causes melting and rough edges — prefer careful mechanical methods and good blade selection.
- PE / PP: flexible and can deform — secure firmly and use blades that minimise friction heating.

## Accessories & finishing tips

- Clamps and guides: F-clamps, quick clamps, and an aluminium extrusion or steel ruler as a guide/fence
- Sanding sequence for edge finishing: 400 → 800 → 1200 grit
- Acrylic edge finish: flame polishing can give optical clarity but risks warping — practice on scrap first
- Keep protective film on acrylic until finishing is complete

## Quick selection table

| Need / Scenario | Recommended method |
|---|---:|
| Batch straight high-precision cuts | Table saw |
| Small quantity, complex shapes | Jigsaw / scroll saw |
| Low-cost straight cuts (thin sheet) | Score & snap |
| High-precision complex contours (only PMMA) | Laser cutter |
