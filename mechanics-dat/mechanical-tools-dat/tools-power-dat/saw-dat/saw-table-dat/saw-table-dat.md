This guide lists metals and conditions that are unsafe or unsuitable for small table saws. It also gives safer tool alternatives for cutting various metals.

## 1) Steel family — HIGH RISK (Do NOT cut)

- Carbon steel
- Alloy steel
- Stainless steel
- Spring steel
- Tool steel

Why not:

- Small table saws run at high RPM (typically 4,000–6,000 RPM) with no coolant
- The blade can overheat instantly and suffer tooth breakage
- Severe kickback and dangerous projectiles

Conclusion: Strictly prohibited

---

## 2) Thick metal (Any material) — NOT SUITABLE / HIGH RISK

- Aluminum sheet ≥ 3–4 mm
- Copper sheet ≥ 2 mm
- Brass sheet ≥ 2 mm
- Large metal profiles (angle, channel, etc.)

Why not:

- Excessive feed resistance
- Small table saws lack torque for heavy cuts
- Blade pinching and flying debris are likely

Conclusion: Avoid; use appropriate metal-cutting equipment

---

## 3) Hard, brittle metals — DANGEROUS (Do NOT cut)

- Cast iron
- Zinc alloys / die-cast parts
- Magnesium alloys

Why not:

- Parts can shatter or chip
- High-speed fragments pose major risk

Conclusion: Strictly prohibited

---

## 4) Thin-walled metal tubes and thin metal sheets — VERY DANGEROUS

- Tubes with wall thickness < 1 mm
- Thin steel/aluminum sheets

Why not:

- Teeth can grab and pull thin-walled parts
- Risk of entanglement, winding, and ejection

Conclusion: Extremely hazardous with a small table saw

## May be cut only under strict, controlled conditions

These are conditional cases where cutting is physically possible but not recommended unless all precautions are met.

Prerequisites:

- Use a metal-specific blade (TCT blade for aluminum or a non-ferrous metal blade)
- Secure the workpiece firmly with proper clamps or fixtures
- Use very low feed and controlled cutting parameters
- Operator must be experienced with metal cutting on small machines

Possible (still not recommended):

- Non-ferrous thin parts only:
  - Aluminum ≤ 2 mm
  - Brass ≤ 1.5 mm
  - Copper ≤ 1 mm

Note: "Can be cut" ≠ "should be cut" — safety and tool life remain major concerns.

## Recommended tools by metal

| Metal / Part            | Recommended tool                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Steel / Stainless       | Metal bandsaw / cold-cut saw / angle grinder with cutoff wheel |
| Large aluminum profiles | Cold-cut saw / dedicated sawing machine                        |
| Thin aluminum sheet     | Jigsaw with metal cutting blades or shearing/cold saw          |
| Small metal rods / bars | Metal bandsaw / hacksaw (manual)                               |

## Micro-size table saw

Small benchtop saws can be useful for wood, plastics, and light hobby work — not for cutting most metals.

---

## Full-size table saw

![](2025-12-18-18-04-24.png)

Full-size, industrial saws with appropriate blades, guards, and coolant systems may handle some non-ferrous metals safely when used with correct blades and feeding methods. Even then, choose a purpose-built metal-cutting machine whenever possible.
