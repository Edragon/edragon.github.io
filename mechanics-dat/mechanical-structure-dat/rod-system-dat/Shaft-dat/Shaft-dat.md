## Shaft cutting

Is it dangerous to cut a 6 mm smooth shaft (steel) with an angle grinder?

Yes. There are risks, especially in the following situations:

1. High angle grinder speed

Angle grinders typically run above 10,000 RPM. When cutting metal, if the workpiece is not clamped securely or the angle is wrong and the shaft rolls, this can cause:

- Hand injury (kickback)
- Workpiece ejection
- Cutting wheel shattering (severe hazard)

2. Round shaft is hard to secure

A round shaft can roll or be grabbed by the wheel, which may lead to:

- Disc jam
- Thrown workpiece

3. Cutting discs are unfriendly to small-diameter metal

Cutting thin rods → easy to bite → can cause kickback

How to make it safer

- Use proper fixturing

  Secure the shaft. Recommended:

  - Use a bench vise (required)
  - Wrap the clamped area with aluminum or wood to prevent slipping

- Use a cut-off disc, not a grinding disc

  Use a metal cut-off disc (thin cut-off). Do not use a grinding disc to sever the shaft.

- Wear personal protective equipment

  - Safety goggles
  - Cut-resistant gloves
  - Long sleeves

- Avoid contacting the wheel side

  Use only the thin cutting edge of the disc; do not apply side pressure.

- Cut gently, do not force

  Keep a steady motion; do not rock the shaft.
