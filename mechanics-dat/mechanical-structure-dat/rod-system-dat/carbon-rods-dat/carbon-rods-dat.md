**Carbon rods** (also called **carbon fiber rods**) are lightweight, high-strength structural components widely used in radio-controlled (RC) aircraft, gliders, multirotors, and other hobby models.

## 1. What Are Carbon Rods?
Carbon rods are made from **carbon fiber strands** bonded together with epoxy resin.  
They are extremely **strong**, **rigid**, and **lightweight**, making them ideal for structural reinforcement in model aircraft.

---

## 2. Key Features
- **High strength-to-weight ratio**  
- **Very stiff** (excellent for wings and fuselage reinforcement)  
- **Corrosion-resistant**  
- **Lightweight compared to metal rods**  
- **Does not warp with humidity or temperature changes**

## 3. Common Shapes
1. **Solid round rods**  
   - Used for spars, pushrods, and general reinforcement  
2. **Hollow tubes**  
   - Lighter than solid rods, used for wing spars or long stiff beams  
3. **Flat strips (carbon plates)**  
   - Used to strengthen fuselage sides, wing trailing edges, or control surfaces  

---

## 4. Typical Uses in RC Aircraft
- **Wing spars** (main structural support inside the wing)  
- **Fuselage reinforcement**  
- **Tail boom structures**  
- **Control pushrods**  
- **Motor mounts** (for lightweight electric planes)  
- **FPV plane rigidity enhancement**  

---

## 5. Advantages in RC Models
- Provides **rigidity** without adding much weight  
- Greatly increases **structural strength**  
- Helps prevent wing flex at high speeds  
- Improves flight precision and durability  

---

## 6. Adhesives and Bonding
Compatible glues include:
- **Epoxy**
- **CA glue (foam-safe when used on foam models)**
- **UHU POR** (for foam aircraft)

Avoid using general hot-melt glue for critical structural joints — it adds weight and low bonding strength.

---

## 7. Common Diameters
- **1mm – 3mm:** pushrods, small wings  
- **3mm – 6mm:** wing spars, fuselage reinforcement  
- **6mm – 10mm:** large wings and long FPV platforms
