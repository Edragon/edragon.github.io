## PVC DN standard 

**DN** = **Nominal Diameter** (measured in millimeters, mm).  
It is a standardized naming system mainly used in ISO, European, and British pipe standards.

### Meaning
- **DN16** → Nominal Diameter **16 mm**
- **DN25** → Nominal Diameter **25 mm**

Note: DN is an approximate *reference size*. Actual inner and outer diameters vary by material and pressure rating.

### Common Outer Diameters (Example: ISO / PPR / PVC Systems)

| DN Size | Typical OD | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **DN16** | ~20–25 mm OD | Small pipe for irrigation or household plumbing |
| **DN25** | ~32–34 mm OD | Common water supply pipe size |

---

### DN vs OD vs ID
- **DN** → Naming size (not exact)
- **OD** → Outer Diameter (actual measured size)
- **ID** → Inner Diameter (depends on wall thickness)

Example (PVC PN16):
- DN25 → OD 32 mm  
- DN16 → OD 20 mm





## PVC tube under hydrostatic pressure

### Overview
Quick reference for hydrostatic pressure effects on PVC tubes and why common PVC piping and joints are unsuitable for deep-water use.

### Pressure basics
- Water pressure increases by ~1 atmosphere (≈ 0.1 MPa) every 10 m of depth.  
- At 100 m depth the absolute pressure is roughly 11 atm ≈ 1.1 MPa.

### Common PVC pressure ratings (internal pressure)
- PN10: rated ~1.0 MPa (≈ 100 m water column)  
- PN16: rated ~1.6 MPa (≈ 160 m water column)

Note: These ratings apply to internal-pressure tests (pipe containing pressurized fluid). External hydrostatic pressure (surrounding water pressing inward) is a different loading condition and can be more damaging.

### Failure modes under external (deep-water) pressure
- Wall collapse (pipe being crushed inward)  
- Deformation at solvent-welded joints  
- Micro-cracks or fissures forming near joints  
- Joint regions are mechanically weaker than the pipe body and typically fail first

### Can ordinary PVC solvent-weld joints survive at 100 m depth?
Short answer: No guarantee. Standard household PVC with solvent-welded joints is not suitable for long-term deep-water use.

### Reasons
1. Solvent-weld joint strength is usually lower than the pipe material itself — joints tend to fail first under high loads.  
2. Joints are vulnerable to deformation from external pressure — compression can open gaps in the sealed zone.  
3. PVC pipe material is not designed for sustained external hydrostatic compression — deep-water loads can produce micro-cracks or permanent deformation.  
4. Temperature fluctuations cause seal fatigue — large temperature changes (common in deep water) increase stresses at joints and accelerate failure.

### Recommendation
For DIY or household use, do not rely on PVC + solvent welding for sustained operation at ~100 m depth. Use purpose-built pressure housings, materials, and joining methods rated for external hydrostatic pressure
