## Spacer / Washer + Pin or Rivet
- Place a **metal or plastic washer** between parts.
- Insert a solid or semi-tubular rivet/pin through the washer.
- Rivet clamps only the washer, leaving a **free gap for rotation**.
- Works with many rivet types and is very precise.

- Also called a **decorative rivet**, commonly used in leather, fabric, or light metal decoration.
- Once installed, the head and shaft clamp the materials tightly.
- **Does NOT allow rotation** and is not suitable as a spacer by itself.
- For **decorative** or permanent fastening**, not mechanical rotation.





## info 

A **rivet** is a type of permanent mechanical fastener used to join two or more pieces of material together, such as metal, plastic, or leather.

### How a Rivet Works
1. A hole is drilled through the materials.
2. The rivet is inserted into the hole.
3. The tail end of the rivet is deformed (flattened or expanded).
4. This creates two “heads” that clamp the materials tightly together.

Once installed, a rivet **cannot be removed without destroying it**, making it a strong and reliable connection.

### Basic Structure
- **Head**: The factory-made top of the rivet.
- **Shank**: The cylindrical body that goes through the hole.
- **Tail**: The end that gets deformed during installation.

---

### Common Types of Rivets
- **Solid Rivet**: Strongest type, used in aircraft and heavy machinery.
- **Blind Rivet (Pop Rivet)**: Installed with a rivet gun, used when only one side is accessible.
- **Hollow Rivet**: Used for leather, fabric, or light materials.
- **Semi-Tubular Rivet**: Used for rotating joints; the tail is partially hollow.

---

### Why Rivets Are Used
- Strong and vibration-resistant
- Simple and low-cost
- Good for thin sheets and layered materials
- Do not loosen like screws can

---

### Simple Explanation
A rivet is **a metal pin that you put through a hole and squash the end to lock two parts together**.




## Can a Rivet Joint Keep a Gap and Allow Rotation?

Yes, a rivet joint **can** keep a controlled gap and allow rotation — but only if you use the correct method. A normal rivet creates a tight, permanent joint that cannot rotate. Here are the practical solutions:

---

### ✅ Method 1: Loose Riveting (Hinge-Style Rivet Joint)
Do not fully squeeze the rivet tail. Leave a small clearance so the two plates are not clamped tightly.

**Effect:**
- The plates stay aligned by the rivet shaft.
- A small gap remains.
- The plates can rotate around the rivet.

**Cons:**
- Gap is hard to control precisely.

- Rotation may not be very smooth.

---

### ✅ Method 2: Add a Washer or Spacer
Place **washers** or a **spacer** between the two plates, then rivet through them.

**Effect:**
- The gap is controlled by the washer/spacer thickness.
- The rivet clamps the spacer, not the plates.
- The joint rotates smoothly and reliably.

👉 This is the **recommended** method for precise rotation.
