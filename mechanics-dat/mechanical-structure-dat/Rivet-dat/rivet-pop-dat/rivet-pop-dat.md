### After a Pop Rivet (Blind Rivet) Is Installed, Can It Rotate?

After a pop rivet (blind rivet) is pulled (installed), it becomes a **tight, permanent, non-rotating joint**.

When the mandrel pulls the rivet:
- The rivet body expands.
- It clamps the material tightly.
- There is **no clearance** for rotation.
- The joint becomes fixed and cannot rotate.

This is the *intended behavior* of a pop rivet.
