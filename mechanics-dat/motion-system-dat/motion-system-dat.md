### GT2_Timing_Pulley_20T_8B_6mm v8

The **GT2 Timing Pulley 20T 8B 6mm (v8)** refers to a specific type of timing pulley used in belt-driven motion systems, often found in 3D printers, CNC machines, and other precision mechanical setups. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its specifications:

- **GT2**: Refers to the pulley type designed for **GT2 timing belts**, which have a 2mm pitch (distance between teeth). This type is commonly used in applications requiring precise movement and low backlash.
- **Timing Pulley**: A mechanical component with teeth that engage with a timing belt to transfer motion with high accuracy.
- **20T**: This pulley has **20 teeth**, which affects the step resolution and speed of the driven mechanism.
- **8B**: Indicates an **8mm bore diameter**, meaning it fits shafts with an 8mm diameter.
- **6mm**: This refers to the **belt width** it is compatible with, which is typically a **6mm-wide GT2 timing belt**.
- **v8**: This likely refers to the **version** or **design iteration** of the pulley.

This pulley is commonly used in precise motion control applications like 3D printing, where smooth and accurate belt-driven motion is needed. Let me know if you need further details! ðŸš€
