| **Usage**             | Used with a **nut** or threaded hole               | Often used **without a nut**, threads into material directly        |
| **Holding Mechanism** | Relies on **external nut** for clamping force      | Creates clamping force by threading directly into the material      |
| **Tools Used**        | Typically needs a **wrench** or **socket**         | Often driven by **screwdriver** or **Allen key**                    |
| **Installation**      | Requires access to **both sides** (to tighten nut) | Can often be installed from **one side** only                       |
| **Thread Type**       | Usually has a **blunt end** and uniform threads    | Often has **pointed or tapered end**, cutting threads into material |
| **Common Example**    | Hex bolt with nut on the other end                 | Wood screw going into wood directly                                 |
