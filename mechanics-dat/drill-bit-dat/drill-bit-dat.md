### Drill Bits: Ceramic Tile vs Glass

No — the drill bits for **ceramic tile** and **glass** are **not exactly the same**, though they are similar in some ways. Here’s the comparison:

| Material         | Recommended Drill Bit                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ceramic Tile** | Carbide-tipped or diamond-tipped tile bit       | Usually has a spear-shaped or pointed tip to pierce the glazed surface without cracking. Works best on glazed surfaces; slower speed, light pressure. |
| **Glass**        | Diamond-tipped or specialized glass/ceramic bit | Often conical or pointed, designed for brittle materials. Must drill at low speed, with water or lubrication, and ideally from both sides.            |

## Key Differences

1. **Tip shape**:  
   - Tile bits often have a **spear point** (good for glazed tiles)  
   - Glass bits have a **small conical/diamond tip** to reduce chipping 

2. **Brittleness**:  
   - Glass is more prone to cracking, so drilling requires more care, water/lubrication, and two-sided drilling.  
   - Tile can usually handle light drilling from one side.

3. **Speed and pressure**:  
   - Both need low speed and light pressure, but glass is **far less forgiving** than tile.

## ✅ Recommended Drill Bits

| Type                               | Use             | Features                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Glass/Ceramic bit (diamond-coated) | Drilling        | Conical tip for brittle materials |
| HSS glass-specific bit             | Small holes     | Low speed, use with cooling       |
| Diamond conical bit                | Precision holes | Best for thick or hard glass      |
