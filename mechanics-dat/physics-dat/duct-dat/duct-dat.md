- [[Thrust-dat]]

A **duct** is a tube or channel designed to **guide airflow** from one point to another.  

- In aviation or RC models, ducts are often **cylindrical or annular structures** around a fan or propeller.  
- The duct **reduces airflow loss**, **improves thrust efficiency**, and can also **protect the blades**.  

**Example uses:**  
- Ducted fan engines on jets or VTOL aircraft  
- Air conditioning vents (same principle)  
- Marine thrusters

## 2. What is a Ducted Fan (涵道风扇)?

A **ducted fan** is a **propeller or fan enclosed in a duct**.  
It is a common propulsion method in:

- RC jets  
- VTOL drones  
- Small electric aircraft  

### How it works:

1. Fan or propeller spins inside the duct.  
2. The duct **accelerates the airflow** and **reduces tip losses**.  
3. The result is **more thrust per rotation** than an open propeller of the same diameter.

## 3. Advantages of Ducted Fans

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Higher efficiency | Duct reduces tip vortices and wasted airflow |
| Safer | Blades are enclosed, reducing risk of injury |
| Quieter | Noise is reduced compared to open propellers |
| Compact design | Fits better in jets or VTOL aircraft with small airframe |

## 4. Common Applications

- **RC Jet aircraft** (EDF – Electric Ducted Fan)  
- **VTOL drones** (quadcopter with ducted fans)  
- **Hovercraft propulsion**  
- **Experimental aircraft** using ducted lift or thrust  

---

### Notes:

- Ducted fans are different from **propellers** because the **duct improves airflow efficiency** and often increases thrust at high speeds.  
- Duct shape, fan diameter, and tip clearance are critical for performance.
