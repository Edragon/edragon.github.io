## calculate 

A bit of math:

Mobula motors + props making around 90-100g of thrust at 50%

Mobula8 weight around 110g with battery 550 mah An ok-ish ratio of thrust to weight is 4:1

Thrust/(camweight+drone weight)

400 / (16+110)= 3.17...

Hence to have a proper flight you'll have to be above 50% throttle most of the time.

It might fly pretty stable with proper PID tuning and filtering but your batteries will burn (maybe even literally)

## info 

**Thrust** is the **force that moves an aircraft, rocket, or vehicle forward**.  
It is usually generated by:

- **Engines** (jet, turboprop, rocket)  
- **Propellers**  
- **Ducted fans**  

Thrust **opposes drag** and allows the vehicle to accelerate or maintain speed.
