### Refractive Index Comparison: Air vs. Optical Materials

Yes, a refractive index of **1.5** is significantly higher than air:

- **Air**: n ≈ 1.0003 (~1.0 for practical purposes)  
- **PMMA (Acrylic)**: n ≈ 1.49  
- **Polycarbonate (PC)**: n ≈ 1.58  
- **Glass (BK7)**: n ≈ 1.51  


### 1. Typical Values

| Type / Grade | Refractive Index (n) | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------|------|
| Light mineral oil (cosmetic grade) | 1.467–1.470 | Common in electronics and lubrication |
| Standard mineral oil (industrial) | 1.468–1.474 | Used in transformers, immersion cooling |
| Heavy mineral oil | 1.474–1.480 | Higher density, more viscous |
| Food-grade mineral oil | 1.467–1.470 | Safe for contact with materials like plastics |



### 1. Typical Refractive Indices of Common Liquids

| Fluid | Refractive Index (n) | Notes |
|-------|--------------------|------|
| Water | 1.333 | Standard, much higher than air |
| Mineral oil | 1.467–1.480 | Common dielectric oil |
| Ethanol | 1.361 | Transparent alcohol |
| Glycerin | 1.473 | Thick, high n |
| Fluorinated liquids (like FC-72, perfluorocarbons) | 1.25–1.28 | Lowest practical liquids, still far from air |
| Liquid helium (near 4K) | 1.026 | Lowest natural fluid n, cryogenic |
| Liquid hydrogen | 1.121 | Low n, cryogenic, dangerous |

### 2. Notes

- **Most fluids have n > 1.2**, which is **20% or more higher than air**.  


## Compensating Optical Changes by Adjusting Lens Position

Yes, you **can compensate for the optical changes** caused by filling a lens assembly with oil or another medium by **adjusting the lens position relative to the sensor**.

---

### 1. Why It Works

- Replacing air (n ≈ 1.0) with oil or solid (n ≈ 1.45–1.5) **increases the optical path length** between lens elements.  
- This shifts the **focus plane** forward or backward.  
- Moving the lens closer or farther from the sensor can **restore focus** on the image plane.
