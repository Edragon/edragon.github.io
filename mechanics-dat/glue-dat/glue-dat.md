## How 502 Glue Works (Cyanoacrylate Adhesive)

502 glue, also known as **super glue**, is primarily made from **cyanoacrylate**. It works based on a **rapid polymerization reaction** triggered by moisture.

---

### üß™ Basic Principle

**1. Composition ‚Äì Cyanoacrylate:**  
502 glue contains cyanoacrylate monomers that remain stable in dry environments. However, when exposed to even tiny amounts of **moisture (like humidity in the air)**, a chemical reaction starts.

**2. Polymerization Triggered by Moisture:**  
When applied to surfaces, the trace moisture on them acts as a **catalyst**, initiating a **rapid chain reaction** that converts the liquid monomers into solid polymers (plastic-like substance).

üëâ This hardening happens within **seconds**.

**3. Exothermic Reaction:**  
The polymerization process **releases heat**. This is why 502 glue can feel hot when accidentally bonded to skin, sometimes causing minor burns.

### üîß Adhesive Characteristics

- Bonds quickly and strongly to various materials like:
  - Metal
  - Plastic
  - Rubber
  - Ceramics
  - Leather
- Dries in seconds
- High bonding strength
- **Not ideal** for long-term high heat or moisture exposure (may become brittle)

---

### üßº How to Remove It

If you accidentally glue your skin or surfaces, try:

- **Nail polish remover (contains acetone)**
- **Soaking in warm soapy water**
- **Gentle peeling or waiting for it to wear off naturally**

---

### üìå Summary

502 glue works by **polymerizing instantly** when in contact with moisture, forming a hard plastic-like bond. It‚Äôs fast, strong, and versatile‚Äîbut must be handled carefully due to its speed and bonding strength.
