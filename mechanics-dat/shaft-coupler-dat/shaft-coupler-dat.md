## Shaft Coupler  

A **shaft coupler** is a mechanical component used to **connect two rotating shafts**. It primarily functions to transmit torque while allowing for slight axial, radial, or angular misalignments.

### Types of Shaft Couplers  

#### 1. Rigid Coupler  
- **Features**: No elasticity, provides a solid connection, requires precise shaft alignment.  
- **Applications**: High-precision CNC machines, industrial machinery.  

#### 2. Flexible Coupler  
- **Features**: Can absorb slight misalignment, reduce vibration, and minimize impact.  
- **Common Types**:  
  - **Jaw Coupling** – Uses an elastomer insert to absorb vibrations; suitable for stepper and servo motors.  
  - **Bellows Coupling** – High torque transmission capability, ideal for precision applications.  
  - **Disc Coupling** – Used in high-speed and high-precision applications, such as robotics and aerospace.  

#### 3. Universal Joint (U-Joint)  
- **Features**: Allows for larger angular misalignment, commonly used for shafts that are not in perfect alignment.  
- **Applications**: Automotive drivetrains, heavy machinery.  

#### 4. Oldham Coupling  
- **Features**: Compensates for significant radial misalignment, commonly used in automation and 3D printing.

### Key Functions of Shaft Couplers  
✅ **Torque Transmission** – Connects the motor to the driven shaft for power transfer.  
✅ **Misalignment Compensation** – Allows slight shaft misalignment, reducing stress.  
✅ **Vibration & Shock Absorption** – Helps dampen vibrations and protect mechanical components.  
✅ **Equipment Protection** – Some couplers act as safety devices in case of overload.
