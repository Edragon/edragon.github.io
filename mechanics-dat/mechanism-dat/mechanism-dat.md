## differential 

A **differential** is an essential device in a vehicle’s drivetrain, usually located in the drive axle.  

## Main Functions
1. **Allow different wheel speeds**  
   - When driving straight, both wheels rotate at the same speed.  
   - When turning, the outside wheel must travel farther, so it rotates faster.  
   - The differential lets wheels rotate at different speeds while still receiving power.  

2. **Torque distribution**  
   - Splits engine torque and delivers it to both wheels.  

3. **Improved handling and stability**  
   - Without a differential, turning would be difficult and could cause tire wear or drivetrain damage.  

## Common Types
- **Open Differential**  
  - Simple, common type.  
  - Loses traction if one wheel slips.  

- **Limited Slip Differential (LSD)**  
  - Restricts excessive wheel speed difference.  
  - Improves traction on slippery surfaces.  

- **Locking Differential**  
  - Forces both wheels to rotate at the same speed.  
  - Useful in off-road conditions.  

- **Active Differential**  
  - Electronically controlled.  
  - Adjusts torque distribution dynamically based on driving conditions.
