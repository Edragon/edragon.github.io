### Method A — Barbed Fitting (Most Common)
Barbed fittings grip tubing using ridges.
- **Steps:**
  1. Find a **barbed nozzle adapter** matching the tube’s inner diameter (ID 6 mm).
  2. Push the tube onto the barb until it fully covers the ridges.
  3. Optionally add a **hose clamp** for extra security.
- **Advantages:** Simple, reliable for pressure under ~2–3 bar.

**Example:**  
For ID 6 mm tubing, use a **6 mm barbed nozzle adapter**.

---

### Method B — Compression Fitting
Compression fittings create a tight seal without clamps.
- **Steps:**
  1. Insert the tube into the fitting.
  2. Tighten the compression nut to seal.
- **Advantages:** Good for high pressure, removable.
- **Disadvantages:** Requires matching fitting size and nut.

---

### Method C — Threaded Adapter with Tube Connector
If the nozzle has a threaded output:
- Use a **threaded adapter**.
- Attach a **barbed or compression fitting**.
- Attach tubing.

---

### Method D — Quick-Connect Fittings
Useful if frequent disconnection is needed.
- **Steps:** Push the tube into a quick-connect nozzle adapter until it clicks.
- **Advantages:** Fast connection/disconnection.

---

## 3. Extra Tips
- Match **ID 6 mm** for the fitting/barb size for an OD 8 mm, ID 6 mm tube.
- Use a **hose clamp** for high pressure or vibration.
- Lubricate the tube end with a small amount of water or silicone grease to make fitting easier.
- Cut tubing squarely for a tight seal.

| Method        | Pros                             | Cons                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Barbed        | Simple, reliable, inexpensive    | Needs hose clamp for high pressure |
| Compression   | High pressure capable, removable | Requires fitting & nut             |
| Threaded      | Versatile                        | Needs adapter                      |
| Quick-Connect | Fast disconnection               | Higher cost                        |
