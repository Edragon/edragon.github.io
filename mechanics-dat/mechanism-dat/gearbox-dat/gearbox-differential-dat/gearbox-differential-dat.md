A **differential gearbox (differential)** is a mechanical device that allows **two output shafts to rotate at different speeds while still transmitting torque**. It is widely used in cars, machinery, and robots.

### 1. Basic Concept

- **Function**:  
  - When a vehicle turns, the left and right wheels travel different distances and must rotate at different speeds.  
  - The differential allows the wheels to spin at different speeds while still transmitting power.

- **Why it's needed**:  
  - Without a differential, wheels would slip, skid, or wear out faster during turns.

---

### 2. Working Principle (Simplified)

A differential typically has **three main parts**:

1. **Input / Pinion Gear**: Connects to the engine or motor to transmit power.  
2. **Planetary / Spider Gears**: Allow the two output shafts to rotate at different speeds.  
3. **Output Shafts / Side Gears**: Connect to the left and right wheels.

- **When turning**:  
  - The inner wheel rotates slower, the outer wheel rotates faster.  
  - The differential automatically adjusts the speed difference between the wheels.

### 3. Types of Differentials

| Type | Features | Application |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Open Differential | Basic type, allows free differential | Standard cars, light vehicles |
| Limited Slip Differential (LSD) | Limits differential when slipping occurs | Off-road vehicles, racing cars |
| Torsen / Planetary Differential | Automatically distributes torque | High-performance cars, AWD vehicles |
| Electronic Differential | Torque distribution controlled electronically | Modern cars, robots |

### 4. Use in Robots or Small Vehicles

- For **4-wheel or 6-wheel independently driven robots**:  
  - **Electronic differential** can replace mechanical differential.  
  - Each wheel can be controlled individually to achieve smooth turning.

---

### ✅ Summary

A differential gearbox is a device that **allows wheels to spin at different speeds while transmitting power**.  
- Essential for **turning and preventing wheel slip**.  
- Types include **open, limited-slip, Torsen, and electronic differential**.  
- In independent motor systems, **software control can replace mechanical differentials**.
