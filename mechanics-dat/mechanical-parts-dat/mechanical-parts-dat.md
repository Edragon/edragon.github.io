Common standard mechanical parts are roughly divided into:

Transmission parts (gears, sprockets, couplings)

Support and positioning parts (pins, sliders, bolts, washers)

Buffer/Damping parts (springs, dampers, buffer blocks)

Connecting parts (keys, splines, chains)

Auxiliary parts (rollers, adjustment screws, circlips)
