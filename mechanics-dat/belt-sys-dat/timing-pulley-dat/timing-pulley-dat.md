## GT2_Timing_Pulley_20T_8B_6mm

- **GT2**: Refers to the tooth profile – 2 mm pitch (distance between teeth), ideal for precise motion control (e.g., 3D printers).
- **20T**: 20 Teeth – the pulley has 20 teeth around its circumference.
- **8B**: 8 mm **inner bore diameter** (fits an 8 mm shaft).
- **6mm**: **Belt width** – designed for 6 mm wide GT2 timing belts.

## Summary:
This is a 20-tooth GT2 pulley with an 8 mm bore, suitable for 6 mm belts. It's commonly used in 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics for accurate belt-driven motion.
