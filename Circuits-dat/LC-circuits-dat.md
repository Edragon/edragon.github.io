## What is an LC Circuit?

An **LC circuit** is a resonant circuit made of:

- **L (Inductor):** Stores energy in a magnetic field.
- **C (Capacitor):** Stores energy in an electric field.

---

### 🔁 How It Works
The LC circuit continuously transfers energy back and forth:
1. The capacitor discharges through the inductor.
2. The inductor builds a magnetic field.
3. The magnetic field collapses, recharging the capacitor with opposite polarity.
4. The cycle repeats — this creates **oscillations**.

### 📶 Resonance
An LC circuit has a **natural resonant frequency**:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

Where:
- `f` = frequency (in Hz)
- `L` = inductance (in henries)
- `C` = capacitance (in farads)

### 🧰 Common Uses
- Radio tuners (to select a station)
- Filters (high-pass, low-pass, band-pass)
- Oscillators (to generate signals)
- Impedance matching networks

### 📷 Example
An AM radio uses an LC circuit to **tune to a specific frequency**, like 1000 kHz, by adjusting `L` or `C`.
