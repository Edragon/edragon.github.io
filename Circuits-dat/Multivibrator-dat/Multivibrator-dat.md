A **multivibrator** is an electronic circuit that generates a **repetitive waveform** without requiring any external input signal (except for power). It is a type of **oscillator** built using transistors, op-amps, or logic gates.

Multivibrators are commonly used in **timing, pulse generation, and waveform shaping** applications.
