## Types of DC Blocking Components

DC blocking components are used to **prevent DC current from passing** while allowing **AC signals** through. Here are the most common types:

---

### 1. **Capacitors** ✅ *Most Common*

- **Function:** Blocks DC, passes AC.
- **Types:**
  - **Ceramic Capacitors** – Small, non-polarized, stable.
  - **Electrolytic Capacitors** – Larger values, polarized.
  - **Film Capacitors** – High precision, good stability.
- **Usage:** Signal coupling, audio circuits, filters.

---

### 2. **Transformers**

- **Function:** Transfers AC between circuits using magnetic coupling; no DC path exists.
- **Blocks:** Both DC voltage and current.
- **Usage:** Power supplies, audio isolation, RF circuits, Ethernet interfaces.

---

### 3. **Inductors (in special configurations)**

- Not usually used **alone** to block DC, but:
  - In **high-pass filters**, when combined with capacitors, can help filter/block DC.

---

### 4. **Optocouplers (for signal isolation)**

- **Function:** Transfers signal using light; electrically isolates input and output.
- **Blocks:** All DC electrical path.
- **Usage:** Microcontroller interfacing, power control.

## Summary Table

| Component     | Blocks DC | Passes AC | Common Use Case            |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Capacitor     | ✅        | ✅        | Audio, analog signals       |
| Transformer   | ✅        | ✅        | Isolation, AC power         |
| Inductor (*)  | ❌        | Partially | Filtering with capacitors   |
| Optocoupler   | ✅        | ❌        | Digital signal isolation    |

> ✅ **Capacitors** are the most common and direct solution for DC blocking in analog circuits.
