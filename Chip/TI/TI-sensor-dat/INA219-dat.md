# INA219 

INA219 is a high-side voltage and current sensor that communicates over I2C. It can measure voltage up to 26V and current up to 3.2A with a resolution of 0.8mV and 0.1mA respectively. It is commonly used in battery monitoring, power management, and current sensing applications.

The INA219 senses across shunts on buses that can vary from 0 to 26 V. The device uses a single 3- to 5.5-V supply, drawing a maximum of 1 mA of supply current
