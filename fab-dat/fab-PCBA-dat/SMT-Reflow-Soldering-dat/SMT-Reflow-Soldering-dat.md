## Causes of Solder Splashes / Solder Balls After Reflow Soldering

### 1. Solder Paste Issues
- **Poor quality solder paste**: uneven particle size or wrong metal content.
- **Expired or improperly stored paste**: absorbs moisture, leading to solder spatter.
- **Excessive solder paste thickness**: too much solder causes overflow and splashes.

### 2. PCB and Component Cleanliness
- **Contaminated PCB surface**: dust, oil, or oxidation reduces flux activity.
- **Oxidized component leads or pads**: poor wetting leads to solder residues.

### 3. Reflow Process Parameters
- **Ramp-up too fast**: flux or moisture evaporates explosively, causing solder balls.
- **Insufficient preheat zone**: solvents not fully evaporated, bursting in reflow zone.
- **Peak temperature too high / soak too long**: excessive solder fluidity, splashes out.

### 4. Printing and Placement Process
- **Stencil design issues**: oversized or wrong-shaped apertures release too much solder.
- **Uneven printing**: paste smearing, stringing, or overflow.
- **Component misplacement**: misaligned parts squeeze solder during reflow.

### âœ… Solutions
1. Use high-quality solder paste, store under low temperature and dry conditions.
2. Optimize stencil aperture design and control paste thickness.
3. Adjust reflow oven profile:
   - Sufficient preheat for solvent/moisture removal.
   - Avoid temperature overshoot in peak zone.
4. Keep PCB and components clean, reduce oxidation.
5. Check placement machine accuracy to avoid component shift.
