# Small-batch Molding Options

A concise guide to three common small-batch molding approaches. Use the table below for a quick comparison, then read the recommended workflows and pros/cons for each option.

| Option | Method                                    |             Ideal quantity |               Mold cost (¥) |            Unit cost (¥) | Summary                                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------: | --------------------------: | -----------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Silicone mold + resin casting             |                     10–300 |                     300–800 |                     5–20 | Golden option — recommended for most small runs       |
| 2      | Aluminum mould / Simple injection mould   |     Very simple parts only |                 1,500–3,000 |                      1–3 | Cost-effective per unit if design is extremely simple |
| 3      | 3D‑printed mould + injection / heat-press | Prototyping / experimental | Varies (material & printer) | Very low (material only) | Low-cost experiments, not for stable production       |

## Option 1 — Silicone Mold + Resin Casting (Strongly recommended)

Best for 10–300 pieces. Balanced cost, surface finish and ease of use.

Costs (typical)

- Silicone mold: ¥300–800
- Resin part (per piece): ¥5–20

Example: 100 pieces (assume mold ¥600, resin ¥10 each)

- Average unit cost = (600 + 100×10) / 100 = ¥16 per piece

Advantages

- Low mold cost
- Failed casts are repairable
- Good surface finish
- Master can be 3D printed (save tooling time)

Limitations

- Parts are not as strong as injection molded items
- Slightly worse dimensional stability compared to injection molding

Tips

- Use a high-quality silicone (shore hardness chosen by demoulding requirements).
- Post-cure resin parts if required for strength/stability.
- Consider vacuum degassing when pouring resin to reduce bubbles.

## Option 2 — Aluminum Mold / Simple Injection Mold (Grey area)

Suitable only for very simple geometries: single cavity, no undercuts, no fine ribs.

Costs (typical)

- Mold: ¥1,500–3,000
- Unit: ¥1–3 (material + simple press running)

When it makes sense

- If the part geometry is extremely simple and you need many pieces (or need higher strength/dimensional stability).
- Note: hidden costs include setup, machining tolerances, and possible rework of the mold.

Limitations

- Not suitable for complex parts (no undercuts, no deep ribs, no thin cores)
- Higher upfront cost and lead time than silicone molds

## Option 3 — 3D-Printed Mold + Injection / Heat-press (Advanced / Experimental)

Workflow

- Print the mold in a high‑temperature resin (or otherwise suitable material).
- Use low-melting-point plastics (or hot melt adhesives) to form parts.

Suitable for

- Rapid experiments, proof-of-concept, or extremely low-cost runs.

Limitations

- Mold lifetime and dimensional stability are limited by print resin and layer strength.
- Not recommended for stable, repeatable production runs.

## Recommendation Summary

- Use Option 1 (silicone + resin) for most small-batch needs (10–300 pcs): lowest risk, good finish, flexible.
- Consider Option 2 only when the part is extremely simple and unit cost must be minimized for larger quantities.
- Use Option 3 only for prototyping and experimental workflows where low cost and speed matter more than long-term stability.

## Quick checklist before choosing

- Quantity required
- Geometric complexity (undercuts, thin ribs, threads)
- Required mechanical strength
- Dimensional tolerance and stability
- Surface finish requirements
- Budget and lead time
