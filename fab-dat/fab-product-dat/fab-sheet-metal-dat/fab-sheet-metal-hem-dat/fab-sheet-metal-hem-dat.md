## Summary

An integral-formed hem (one-piece hem) is essentially: using machine capability to trade for consistency and reliability.

- Yes — the entry threshold is definitely higher.
- Not just slightly higher: it's a step up in difficulty and equipment requirements.

## What is an integral-formed hem?

An integral-formed hem means folding the edge of the same sheet material back to 180° so the hem is formed from a single piece without adding separate parts. This requires stable, repeatable forming on the original workpiece.

## Why the equipment threshold is higher

Forming a one-piece hem on the same blank imposes three hard requirements on the equipment:

1. Progressive forming capability
2. High repeatability (precision)
3. Surface quality control

### Quick comparison table

| Requirement | Why it matters | What the machine must provide |
|---|---:|---|
| Progressive forming | A single aggressive bend will fail or be inconsistent | Multi-step forming with controllable angles and force
| High repeatability | Hem radius, thickness, and straightness must be consistent part-to-part | High rigidity, accurate guiding, and precise positioning
| Surface quality control | Avoid cracks, waviness, and tool marks on the hem and adjacent area | Dedicated forming tooling, smooth forming surfaces or rollers

## Detailed requirements

- Progressive forming capability
  - Do not form the hem in one hit. The process must be executed in multiple controlled passes with adjustable angles and loads.
  - Ordinary press brakes or simple presses typically cannot achieve stable, repeatable one-piece hems.

- High repeatability (precision)
  - Every finished hem must match targets for:
    - Radius
    - Material thickness in the hem area
    - Straightness/flatness of the hem and adjacent panel
  - Equipment must be stiff, with precise guides and repeatable positioning.

- Surface quality control
  - Defects to avoid:
    - Tearing or cracking
    - Waviness or buckling
    - Press marks or visible scoring
  - Achieve this with specially shaped forming faces, rollers, or tooling that distribute force and protect the surface.

## Key metrics to control

- Hem radius tolerance
- Hem cross-section thickness
- Local flatness / straightness near the hem
- Surface finish (no visible marks, scratches, or tears)

## Common defects and causes

- Crack / tear — too aggressive a single bend or insufficient material flow control
- Waviness / buckling — uneven compression or lack of progressive forming
- Press marks / indentations — improper tooling surface or excessive local pressure

## Equipment and tooling checklist

- Ability to program/perform multi-pass forming with controlled angles and loads
- High structural rigidity and accurate guides (for repeatability)
- Dedicated forming dies or rollers with smooth contact surfaces
- Means to control and measure part location consistently (fixturing, clamps)
- Process monitoring (force, stroke, angle) and ability to adjust on the fly

## Process notes / best practices

- Use gradual, multi-stage bends rather than a single full-angle stroke.
- Match tooling geometry to material thickness and desired hem radius.
- Validate process with sample parts; measure radius, thickness, and flatness across samples.
- Inspect surface after each forming stage to catch defects early.
