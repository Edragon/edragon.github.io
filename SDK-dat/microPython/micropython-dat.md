## About micropython:

Since the memory of STM32F401 is small, you need to install flash to simulate a USB flash drive. Recommended flash: W25Q32JVSSIQ 32MBit

The memory of STM32F411 is twice as large, so you donâ€™t need an external flash to simulate a USB flash drive

Open the USB flash drive, edit the main.py file, click Save, and reset the MCU to execute the program.
