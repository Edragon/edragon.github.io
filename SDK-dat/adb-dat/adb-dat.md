## Can You Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge)?

ADB works only if the device runs Android (or a compatible system) with the following in place:

- Android OS (or equivalent) installed on the device.
- ADB daemon (adbd) running on the device.
- USB gadget mode set up (e.g., g_android, g_ether) to expose the ADB interface over USB.
