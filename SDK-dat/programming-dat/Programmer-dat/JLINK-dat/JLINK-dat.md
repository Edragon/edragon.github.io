## About J-Link 


* J-Link-OB developed by Segger, for development board "on-board"
* Interface include JTAG and SWD, simple version only have SWD
* Support IDE: J-Flash ARM„ÄÅKeil MDK-ARM„ÄÅIAR EWARM„ÄÅCoIDE„ÄÅmikroC PRO for ARM„ÄÅnRFgo Studio
* Supported MCUs: ST„ÄÅFreecale„ÄÅnuvoton„ÄÅNXP„ÄÅTI, Cypress, Atmel, Analog, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Energy Micro and more
* Could be detected as fake in MDK, so not as good as STLINK or DAPLINK

## usage 

![](2025-09-23-13-24-54.png)

- VOUT is a 3.3V voltage output pin.
- Users can remove the internal shorting jumper of the device to disable the 3.3V output.
- VTREF is the internal voltage reference; this pin must be connected to

# What is a BULK Interface (USB)?

A **BULK interface** is a type of **USB transfer mode** defined by the USB specification.  
It is used for **large, non-time-critical data transfers** between a USB device and a host.

---

## Key Points

- **Purpose**: Moves large amounts of data reliably, without strict timing.
- **Error Handling**: Each transfer is error-checked (CRC). If errors occur, the host retries.
- **Speed**: Uses all available USB bandwidth that isn‚Äôt reserved for other transfers.
- **Transfer Size**:
  - USB 2.0 ‚Üí up to **64 KB per transfer**, with max **512 bytes per packet** (High-Speed).
  - USB 3.0 ‚Üí larger packet sizes (up to **1024 bytes**).
- **Scheduling**: Lowest priority compared to isochronous or interrupt transfers.  
  The host only sends bulk data when bus time is free.

---

## Examples of Devices Using BULK Transfers
- **USB flash drives** (file transfers).
- **Printers** (sending print jobs).
- **Scanners** (image data).
- **Custom devices** (MCU development boards, DA14585 debug/test interfaces, etc.).

## Comparison with Other USB Transfers

| Transfer Type   | Use Case                     | Priority | Guaranteed Bandwidth | Error Handling |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Control**     | Device configuration (setup) | Highest  | Yes                  | Yes            |
| **Isochronous** | Audio/video streaming        | High     | Yes                  | No retry       |
| **Interrupt**   | Small, quick signals (mouse) | Medium   | Yes                  | Yes            |
| **Bulk**        | Large, non-urgent data       | Lowest   | No                   | Yes            |

üëâ In short: A **BULK interface** is a **USB data channel** used for transferring large, reliable chunks of data when timing is not critical.
