## Note: 

Regarding the SPI voltage description, everyone knows that the IO port voltage of the CSR86XX series is 1.8V, so the SPI programming voltage also requires 1.8V. Of course, it can also work with 3.3V, but if the SPI level of 3.3V is used, it will probably It will cause five thousandths of the chip to be damaged, which is not a big deal for developers, but for mass production, the problem is very serious!
