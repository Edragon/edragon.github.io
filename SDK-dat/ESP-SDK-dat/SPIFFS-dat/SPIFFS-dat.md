the most simple solution is to use Arduino IDE 1.x when you need to upload a filesystem to your ESP32 board. The download links for Arduino IDE 1.x are listed here:

https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#legacy-ide-18x

It does these things using two command line tools:

- [mkspiffs](https://github.com/igrr/mkspiffs)

### ESP32FS

https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases/

Go to the sketchbook location, and create a tools folder.

4) Unzip the downloaded .zip folder. Open it and copy the ESP32FS folder to the tools folder you created in the previous step. You should have a similar folder structure:

<Sketchbook-location>/tools/ESP32FS/tool/esp32fs.jar

### SPIFFS Download

Here are the most common methods to download files from SPIFFS on ESP32:

#### 1. Using a Web Server (Recommended)
- Run a web server on your ESP32 and access files via your browser.
- **ESPAsyncWebServer Library**: Popular for asynchronous web servers.
- **Example Sketches**: "FSBrowser" (File → Examples → WebServer) demonstrates serving/downloading files from SPIFFS.
- **File Manager Libraries**: ESPFMfGK offers drag-and-drop web interfaces for SPIFFS management.

**Steps:**
1. Set up ESP32 as Wi-Fi Access Point or connect to your network.
2. Upload a sketch with a web server to ESP32 (serves SPIFFS files).
3. Open your browser and go to ESP32's IP address.
4. Download files directly from the web interface.

#### 2. Using a Dedicated File System Downloader
- Projects like [`maxgerhardt/pio-esp32-esp8266-filesystem-downloader`](https://github.com/maxgerhardt/pio-esp32-esp8266-filesystem-downloader) let you download the entire SPIFFS image over serial.
- Useful for debugging and backup.

#### 3. Accessing Files via Serial Port (Text/Debug)
- Read SPIFFS file contents and print to Serial Monitor.
- Good for debugging or small text files.
- Open Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE or other terminal to view output.

#### 4. Third-Party Tools (ESP-IDF)
- Tools like [`octopus-framework/spiffs-dumper`](https://github.com/octopus-framework/spiffs-dumper) can extract files from SPIFFS partitions using ESP-IDF.
- Useful if you prefer not to use web servers or need offline access.
