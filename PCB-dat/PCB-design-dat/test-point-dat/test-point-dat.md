- small batch production can use multimeter to do the test 

add points like 

for power supply - [[power-dat]]

- VBUS
- 3V3
- GND

[[epaper-dat]] 

- GDR 
- RESET 
- VCOM 
- PREVGL
- PREVGH


- VCOM: Usually between -2V and -3V (sometimes adjustable, check your moduleâ€™s datasheet).
- PREVGL: Negative voltage, often around -15V to -20V.
- PREVGH: Positive voltage, often around +15V to +20V.

VOM 

PRE-VGL == -20V

PRE-VGH == 20V
