## Methods to Examine Hidden Solder Bridges Under Packages

| Method                         | Description                                                                 | Pros                                     | Cons / Limitations                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **X-Ray Inspection**           | Uses 2D or 3D X-ray (AXI/CT) to image solder joints under the package.      | Most reliable, can see voids, bridges, opens | Expensive equipment, not DIY friendly  |
| **Microscope with Oblique Light** | Tilted inspection around chip edges, sometimes you can see solder "squeeze-out". | Cheap, immediate check                   | Only shows gross defects near edges     |
| **Electrical Continuity Test** | Use multimeter to check resistance between adjacent pins/pads.              | Simple, effective for shorts              | Cannot detect open joints or cold solder|
| **Boundary Scan (JTAG)**       | IC self-tests connectivity if supported.                                    | Automated, precise                       | Only available if IC has JTAG support   |
| **Thermal Camera / IR Imaging**| Power up board, shorts often cause local hot spots.                         | Non-contact, quick check                 | Needs power-on, risk of damage          |
| **Flying Probe / ICT Test**    | Automated test system probes nets for shorts/opens.                         | Precise, production use                  | Expensive, setup time                   |
| **Acoustic Microscopy (SAM)**  | Ultrasound imaging can detect voids or poor solder bonding.                 | High resolution for reliability testing  | Very expensive, lab equipment only      |


For hobbyist / small-lab use:

**Best option**: Electrical continuity check with a **multimeter** (between power rails, adjacent pins).

Second best: If you suspect hidden bridges, try **thermal camera** (small USB IR cameras are affordable).

Pro-level: Use an **X-ray machine** (common in professional PCB assembly houses).

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re debugging **why the IC doesnâ€™t work after reflow**, Iâ€™d suggest:

Check for shorts with multimeter.

Power briefly, then feel for **overheating** (carefully) or use thermal camera.

If nothing obvious, suspect **opens (unsoldered pads)**, which can only be 100% confirmed by X-ray or functional testing.



## DIY Methods to Detect Hidden Solder Bridges Under Packages (No X-Ray)

| Method                         | How It Works                                                                 | Notes / Tips |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Multimeter Continuity Check**| With power off, measure resistance between power rails (VCCâ€“GND) and between suspect pins. | If you read ~0Î© or very low resistance, there may be a bridge. |
| **Current-Limited Power Test** | Power board with a bench supply set to current limit (e.g. 50â€“100mA). If supply immediately hits limit, thereâ€™s likely a short. | Use low limit to avoid chip damage. |
| **Thermal Finger Test / IR Camera** | Briefly power on with current limit. A solder bridge often causes a tiny hot spot. | Safer with cheap USB thermal cameras. |
| **Rosin / Alcohol Wetting**    | Apply isopropyl alcohol or rosin flux around package edges, then power board. If there is a short, liquid may boil or show bubbles near bridged pads. | Not very precise, but sometimes works. |
| **Resistance Mapping**         | Compare resistance between ground and each I/O pin versus a known-good board. | Detects anomalies indirectly. |
| **Functional "Wiggle Test"**   | Gently press down or heat package with hot air. If circuit suddenly works or fails, some pads may be bridged or floating. | Risky â€” only use for debugging prototypes. |

Practical DIY Workflow

**First step**: Check resistance between **VCC and GND** before powering. If itâ€™s suspiciously low, suspect a bridge.

**Second step**: Use **current-limited bench supply** to power on â€” check for overheating.

**Third step**: If possible, use **cheap thermal camera** (even phone add-ons) to find hot spots.

**Last resort**: Rework package with **flux + hot air and reflow** â€” often fixes hidden bridges without even finding them.

ðŸ‘‰ This way you donâ€™t need expensive X-ray, just a multimeter, alcohol/flux, and maybe a thermal camera.
