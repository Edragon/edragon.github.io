## Glossary

### DCM = documentation file 

If you don’t copy the DCM files, you will lose the documentation. I believe that the library will otherwise still function but don’t quote me on that; you can try it and find out.

(maybe goes with out saying, but in v6 you only have a single .kicad_sym file which contains all the info)

### .mod
** Files that end in “.kicad_mod”, typically in folders with names that end in “.pretty”, are the 2014(?) version of modules (a KiCad “module” is called a “footprint” or a “decal” in other CAD software), one footprint per file, lots of files in the entire “.pretty” library.*

** Files that end in “.mod” are module libraries (a KiCad “module” is called a “footprint” or a “decal” in other CAD software)*


## Tips
