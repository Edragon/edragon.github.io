## Product Overview:

KP182/4 series electronic loads can be widely used in LED lighting, power supplies, chargers, batteries, and other industries for product testing and aging. Its current mode can be used to simulate a resistive load to discharge batteries and load power supplies; its voltage mode can be used to simulate a capacitive load for chargers and can simulate the constant voltage characteristics of LEDs to load LED drive power supplies. It is simple to use, easy to adjust, has perfect protection functions, and its performance and functions are incomparable to traditional slide-wire resistors. Used in related industries, it can greatly improve production efficiency and reduce costs.
