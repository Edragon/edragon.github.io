Yes, the tip of a soldering iron usually has a surface coating, not just bare copper or iron. This coating serves several purposes: preventing corrosion, improving heat transfer, and extending lifespan. Common types of coatings include:

1. **Iron Plating**  
   - Most soldering iron tips have a copper core, but copper oxidizes easily and wears quickly.  
   - The surface is plated with iron to prevent oxidation and improve durability.  
   - Advantages: High temperature resistance and long lifespan.

2. **Nickel or Chrome Plating**  
   - Some tips add a layer of nickel or chrome on top of the iron plating.  
   - Purpose: Further corrosion resistance and increased surface hardness.

3. **Solder Coating (Tin layer, formed during use)**  
   - When first used, a thin layer of solder forms on the tip from molten solder or flux.  
   - This tin layer protects the tip from oxidation and improves soldering performance.  
   - Tip: Always apply a thin layer of solder after use to extend the tipâ€™s life.

4. **Ceramic or Special Coatings (on some high-end tips)**  
   - Some high-temperature or specialty soldering tips have ceramic coatings.  
   - Purpose: Corrosion resistance, high temperature tolerance, and reduced solder sticking.

**Summary**: The core is usually copper, with an iron plating, sometimes additional nickel/chrome, and a protective tin layer forms during use.
