## pick-up error 

Dear customer,

Shipping cost by Fedex to Israel has raised recently from 35 to 50 usd, they will need an extra 15 usd to be added for your shipment.

Very sorry for this issue! This shipping cost changes from time to time.

There a couple of options to resolve this:

- If you still want to use the express shipping option, please consider directly sending the extra cost to info@electrodragon.com, and reply to the email back.

- use alternative shipping methods:

    - PFCEXPRESS to Israel, the estimated delivery time is about 12-25 days. This is a combination of the fast international shipment and local delivery.
    - And extra shipping cost will be refunded back via the original payment method.

- Order cancel, please simply let us know by email back.
