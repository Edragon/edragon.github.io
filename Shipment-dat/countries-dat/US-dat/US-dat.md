香港DHL渠道美国邮编32和33以及34开头的邮编申报都需要提供交易证明（客户务必确保真实）才能接收托运，无法确认后果自负出货。否则香港DHL会拒收。另外强烈建议客户托运美国32-34开头邮编的货物选择我司UPS或者联邦渠道出货。

For shipments via Hong Kong DHL to US zip codes starting with 32, 33, or 34, a transaction proof (customers must ensure authenticity) is required for declaration and acceptance. If this cannot be confirmed, shipment is at your own risk. Otherwise, Hong Kong DHL will refuse to accept the shipment. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that customers shipping to US zip codes starting with 32-34 use our UPS or FedEx channels instead.

## Shipping Hold Notification (Effective April 23rd, 2025)

*   **Affected Services (US Routes):** PFCEX, PFCEXB, PFCEXPRESS, EURPOST, PFCGL, USPST.
*   **Shipment Hold:** Starting April 23rd, 2025, shipments using the affected services destined for the United States will be temporarily held in our warehouse.
*   **Reason for Hold:** This measure is taken in anticipation of new US customs tariff regulations expected to be finalized on May 2nd, 2025.
*   **Dispatch Schedule:** Held shipments will be dispatched after May 2nd, once the new tariff details are confirmed and implemented.
*   **Customs Fees:** Please note that customs duties and clearance processing fees were *not* pre-collected for shipments dispatched via these services on or after April 23rd. After the new tariffs are finalized on May 2nd, any applicable fees will be assessed and collected retrospectively, if necessary, before the final dispatch of the goods.
*   **Customer Communication:** We kindly request that you communicate this temporary hold to your customers. Shipping immediately carries a higher risk of customs inspections in the destination country, potentially leading to delays ranging from two weeks to a month. Holding the shipments in the warehouse during this transition period is considered a safer approach to minimize potential inspection-related delays.

## General Updates

#### U.S. Customs Requirements Across Different Shipping Channels (as of 2025-04-16)

This post summarizes the U.S. customs requirements detailed in the provided shipping channel documents.  A key update across all channels is the cancellation of the 800 USD de minimis threshold, meaning all goods may be subject to tariffs.

**Common Requirements (Repeated Across All Documents):**

*   **Tariff Policy Change:**  The U.S. government issued an executive order on February 1, 2025, increasing tariffs on all goods from China by 10%, effective February 4, 2025. The 800 USD tariff exemption is no longer in effect.
*   **Accurate Information is Crucial:** Shippers are responsible for providing truthful and complete cargo information, including product name, amount, quantity, destination country HS Code, and weight.  Consequences of inaccurate information (detention, delays, confiscation, supplementary taxes, fines) are borne by the sender.
*   **MID Code:** The Manufacturer Identification Code (MID) is essential for US customs declaration. It serves as a substitute for the manufacturer's/shipper's/exporter's full name and address.
*   **MID Code Generation:**
    1.  **Country Code:** Two-letter ISO code of the supplier's country (e.g., GB for the United Kingdom).
    2.  **Company Name:** First three letters of the first two "words" in the company name. If no clear word separation, use the first six letters.
    3.  **Address Number:** Largest number from the address line (up to four digits).
    4.  **City Name:** First three letters of the city name.
*   **MID Code Example:**
    *   Company Name: ABC Company
    *   Address: 236 Wendell Ford Blvd, Ste 1304
    *   City: Erlanger
    *   Country: United States
    *   MID Code: USABC236ERL
*   **MID Code Precautions:** The MID Code must be accurate. Provincial codes may be needed for some cases (e.g., Canada). The largest number in the address should be selected.
*   **HS Code:** Provide accurate product names, ingredients, and HS Codes.
*   **US HS Code query website:** htps://rulings.cbp.gov/home
