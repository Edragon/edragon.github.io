## U.S. Customs Requirements Across Different Shipping Channels (as of 2025-04-16)

This post summarizes the U.S. customs requirements detailed in the provided shipping channel documents.  A key update across all channels is the cancellation of the 800 USD de minimis threshold, meaning all goods may be subject to tariffs.

**Common Requirements (Repeated Across All Documents):**

*   **Tariff Policy Change:**  The U.S. government issued an executive order on February 1, 2025, increasing tariffs on all goods from China by 10%, effective February 4, 2025. The 800 USD tariff exemption is no longer in effect.
*   **Accurate Information is Crucial:** Shippers are responsible for providing truthful and complete cargo information, including product name, amount, quantity, destination country HS Code, and weight.  Consequences of inaccurate information (detention, delays, confiscation, supplementary taxes, fines) are borne by the sender.
*   **MID Code:** The Manufacturer Identification Code (MID) is essential for US customs declaration. It serves as a substitute for the manufacturer's/shipper's/exporter's full name and address.
*   **MID Code Generation:**
    1.  **Country Code:** Two-letter ISO code of the supplier's country (e.g., GB for the United Kingdom).
    2.  **Company Name:** First three letters of the first two "words" in the company name. If no clear word separation, use the first six letters.
    3.  **Address Number:** Largest number from the address line (up to four digits).
    4.  **City Name:** First three letters of the city name.
*   **MID Code Example:**
    *   Company Name: ABC Company
    *   Address: 236 Wendell Ford Blvd, Ste 1304
    *   City: Erlanger
    *   Country: United States
    *   MID Code: USABC236ERL
*   **MID Code Precautions:** The MID Code must be accurate. Provincial codes may be needed for some cases (e.g., Canada). The largest number in the address should be selected.
*   **HS Code:** Provide accurate product names, ingredients, and HS Codes.
