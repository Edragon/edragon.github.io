**About MID:**

MID Code (Manufacturer Identification Code) is mainly used for US customs declaration, and is a substitute code for the full name and address of the manufacturer, shipper or exporter. The following are the MID Code generation rules:

1.  Country code

    *   Use the two-letter ISO code of the supplier's country. For example:
        *   GB: United Kingdom
2.  Company name

    *   Take the first three letters of the first two "words" in the company name. For example:
        *   ABC Company → ABC
        *   L.S. Ayres Company → LSA
    *   If there is no obvious word separation in the company name, take the first six letters.
3.  Address number

    *   Extract the largest number from the address line, up to four digits. For example:
        *   236 Wendell Ford Blvd → 236
        *   1234 Main Street → 1234
        *   49 250th St → 49
4.  City name

    *   Take the first three letters of the city name. For example:
        *   St. Louis → STL
        *   London → LON

**Example**

Assume a manufacturer has the following details:

*   Company Name: ABC Company
*   Address: 236 Wendell Ford Blvd, Ste 1304
*   City: Erlanger
*   Country: United States

The MID Code is generated as follows:

1.  Country code: US
2.  Company name: ABC
3.  Address number: 236
4.  City name: ERL

The final generated MID Code is: USABC236ERL.

**Precautions**

*   The MID Code must be generated accurately according to the above rules, otherwise, the customs documents may be returned.
*   For some special cases (such as Canada), provincial codes may need to be used.
*   If the address contains multiple numbers, the largest number should be selected.
