**US Tariff Requirements for 2025**

Reminder regarding documents for goods going to the United States and Puerto Rico:

*   Documents are not affected;
*   MID is not required for direct shipment below 250USD;
*   MID is required for shipments between 250-800 USD (regardless of whether customs declaration is required). Currently, IOR is not required for goods of this value;
*   For declared goods above 800 USD, the importer's tax ID and MID must be provided for shipment.

Because the United States has eliminated the 800 USD de minimis threshold, all goods may be subject to tariffs. Please be sure to provide accurate product names, ingredients, HS Codes, and other information when preparing documents.

**About MID:**

The MID Code (Manufacturer Identification Code) is mainly used for US customs declaration and is a substitute code for the full name and address of the manufacturer, shipper, or exporter. The following are the rules for generating the MID Code:

1.  Country Code

    *   Use the two-letter ISO code of the supplier's country. For example: • GB: United Kingdom
2.  Company Name

    *   Take the first three letters of the first two "words" in the company name. For example:
        *   ABC Company → ABC
        *   L.S. Ayres Company → LSA
    *   If there is no obvious word separation in the company name, take the first six letters.
3.  Address Number

    *   Extract the largest number from the address line, up to four digits. For example:
        *   236 Wendell Ford Blvd → 236
        *   1234 Main Street → 1234
        *   49 250th St → 49
4.  City Name

    *   Take the first three letters of the city name. For example:
        *   St. Louis → STL
        *   London → LON

**Example**

Suppose a manufacturer's details are as follows:

*   Company Name: ABC Company
*   Address: 236 Wendell Ford Blvd, Ste 1304
*   City: Erlanger
*   Country: United States

The process of generating its MID Code is as follows:

1.  Country Code: US
2.  Company Name: ABC
3.  Address Number: 236
4.  City Name: ERL

The final generated MID Code is: USABC236ERL.

**Precautions**

*   The MID Code must be generated accurately according to the above rules, otherwise it may cause the customs documents to be returned.
*   For some special cases (such as Canada), provincial codes may need to be used.
*   If the address contains multiple numbers, the largest number should be selected.

**Urgent Notice Regarding Changes to US Tariff Policy ‼‼**

On February 1, 2025, the US government issued an executive order announcing a 10% tariff increase on all goods from China. The new rules will take effect on February 4, 2025. All goods from China to the United States will no longer enjoy the 800 USD tariff exemption policy and will be subject to an additional 10% tariff on the original tax rate (the final tariff for various products ranges from 10-60% or more).

At the same time, please be sure to truthfully fill in the cargo information when shipping, including but not limited to product name, amount, quantity, destination country HS Code, weight, and other information, and ensure the authenticity, accuracy, and completeness of the declared information. All consequences and costs resulting from customs detention, delays, confiscation, supplementary tax payments, and additional fines caused by the US Customs revaluation will be borne by the sender. Once your company delivers the goods, it will be deemed that you have carefully read and defaulted to abide by the above notice!

Affected by this policy, for the goods/packages you entrust, our company will indefinitely collect US import taxes and fees from you. We will update synchronously if there are any policy updates. Thank you for your understanding!
