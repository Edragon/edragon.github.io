Introduction to Hong Kong DHL Agent (HKDHL) Channel

## Channel Description:

1.  Accepts general goods and products with internal batteries, but not products with output functions (can charge other devices).
2.  For shipments within 1KG, the number of batteries must not exceed 2. If there are more than 2 batteries, they must be packed in cardboard boxes.
3.  The outer box must not have dangerous goods labels, nor should it reflect dangerous goods packaging wording.
4.  Countries requiring original invoices: Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Romania, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Tanzania, Turkey, Guatemala, Iraq, India, Chile, United Arab Emirates (declarations exceeding 13587USD)
5.  Length cm X Width cm X Height cm / 5000, single ticket billing weight <300KG. (Above 21KG, less than 1KG is calculated as 1KG)
6.  For overseas returns caused by non-DHL reasons, the return shipping costs and related return costs shall be borne by the sender.
7.  DHL only accepts goods with fragile labels (whether wooden or cardboard boxes), and there may be a non-stackable fee of 2500RMB * fuel surcharge.
8.  Timor-Leste and Maldives DHL prohibit and do not accept products with batteries.
9.  Effective immediately: For US zip codes starting with 32, 33, and 34 via the Hong Kong DHL channel, declarations need to be above 800USD for us to accept the consignment; otherwise, Hong Kong DHL will reject it. In addition, for goods with US zip codes starting with 32, 33, and 34 that are below 800USD, customers can choose to use our UPS or FEDEX channel for consignment.

    This can be understood as follows: For Hong Kong DHL US zip codes between 32 and 34:

    *   US private shipments (including commercial shipments) with zip codes between 32-34: require declarations above 800USD (and transaction proof must be provided), otherwise there is still a risk of return.
    *   US Amazon shipments (including overseas warehouse shipments) with zip codes between 32-34: require declarations above 800USD + prepaid duties (need to add a normal 30% customs pre-payment deposit) (and transaction proof must be provided), otherwise there is still a risk of return.

## Declaration Requirements:

DHL Notice: For all shipments to Mexico (MX) with a declared value of less than 2500USD, customs clearance requires the importer's tax ID (RFC) / recipient's tax ID (personal ID (CURP)).

Mexican customs requires the recipient to provide legal proof of identity for tax purposes:

1.  Company: Provide tax ID;
2.  Individual: Provide tax ID or personal ID number;
3.  Foreigner: Provide foreign tax ID or personal ID number.

The invoice must provide complete importer/recipient information, including name, address, phone number, and email.

In addition, the invoice must also have a detailed description of the goods, including detailed product name, customs code, material, use, quantity, unit price, number of pieces, currency, total value, country of origin, etc.

For all express channels to the destination countries "Qatar (QA), Kuwait (KW), Oman (OM)", the commercial invoice needs to provide a 12-digit customs code. The customs codes (HS CODE) for Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait will be adjusted from 8 digits to 12 digits. From January 1, 2025, all parcels sent to these three countries must include the 12-digit customs code (HS CODE) on the commercial invoice. Failure to provide these codes may result in customs clearance delays. If returns or failure to clear customs are caused by customs code issues, all problems will be borne by the sender.

## Declared Value:

Due to serious under-declaration in Europe, all shipments to European countries with a declared value below EUR100 (including EUR100) must provide transaction proof; otherwise, DHL will return the shipment. Transaction proof requirements are as follows:

1.  Only clear English versions of transaction proof are accepted.
2.  The transaction proof must be a genuine transaction proof between the buyer and seller.
3.  The product information in the transaction proof must match the invoice.

The above requirements are effective immediately. If the goods do not follow the above requirements, the sender will be responsible for any delays and other costs incurred!

## Additional Fees:

1.  If any side of a single piece exceeds 98CM (including 98CM), an extra-long fee of 165 RMB/piece * fuel surcharge will be charged.

    If the weight of a single piece exceeds 69KG (including 69KG), an overweight fee of 900 RMB/piece * fuel surcharge will be charged.

    If the actual weight of a single piece exceeds 24KG-68KG (23.501 is calculated as 24kg), a difficult-to-handle fee of 165 RMB/piece * fuel surcharge will be charged.

    These three are not cumulative. If a piece is both extra-long and overweight, the larger amount will be charged. If DHL charges us extra-long or overweight fees after the goods are exported, we will charge the sender for this fee.

    DHL's maximum acceptable size limit: within 298*198*158cm. Anything exceeding this will not be accepted.
2.  Address change fee: 100 RMB/ticket
3.  Non-stackable handling fee: 1250 RMB*U/ticket.

## Possible Local Charges:

If the package is in the local area, such as not being cleared or signed for within 3 working days, this fee will be incurred.

Avoid returns and more storage fees (the United States has storage fees of 31 USD/day).

## Special Countries:

## US 2025 Tariff Requirements:

Reminder of documents for goods going to the United States and Puerto Rico:

*   Documents are not affected;
*   MID is not required for direct shipment below 250USD;
*   MID is required for shipment between 250-800 USD (regardless of whether it is declared), and the IOR of this value of goods is currently not required;
*   For declared goods above 800 USD, the importer's tax number and MID must be provided for shipment.

Because the United States has cancelled the 800 USD threshold, all goods may be subject to tariffs. Please be sure to provide accurate product names, ingredients, HS Codes and other information when making the list.

### About MID:

The MID Code (Manufacturer Identification Code) is mainly used for US customs declaration and is a substitute code for the full name and address of the manufacturer, shipper, or exporter. The following are the MID Code generation rules:

1.  Country code

    *   Use the two-letter ISO code of the supplier's country. For example: • GB: United Kingdom
2.  Company name

    *   Take the first three letters of the first two "words" in the company name. For example:
        *   ABC Company → ABC
        *   LS Ayres Company → LSA
    *   If there is no obvious word separation in the company name, take the first six letters.
3.  Address number

    *   Extract the largest number from the address line, up to four digits. For example:
        *   236 Wendell Ford Blvd → 236
        *   1234 Main Street → 1234
        *   49 250th St → 49
4.  City name

    *   Take the first three letters of the city name. For example:
        *   St. Louis → STL
        *   London → LON

#### Example

Assume a manufacturer has the following details:

*   Company Name: ABC Company
*   Address: 236 Wendell Ford Blvd, Ste 1304
*   City: Erlanger
*   Country: United States

The MID Code is generated as follows:

1.  Country code: US
2.  Company Name: ABC
3.  Address number: 236
4.  City name: ERL

The final generated MID Code is: USABC236ERL.

#### Precautions

*   The MID Code must be generated accurately according to the above rules, otherwise, the customs documents may be returned.
*   For some special cases (such as Canada), provincial codes may need to be used.
*   If the address contains multiple numbers, the largest number should be selected.

### Urgent Notice Regarding Changes to US Tariff Policy ‼‼

On February 1, 2025, the US government issued an executive order announcing a 10% tariff increase on all goods from China. The new regulations will take effect on February 4, 2025. All goods from China to the United States will no longer enjoy the 800 USD tariff exemption policy and will be subject to an additional 10% tariff on the original tax rate (the final tariff for various products ranges from 10-60% or more).

At the same time, please be sure to fill in the cargo information truthfully when shipping, including but not limited to the product name, amount, quantity, destination country HS Code, weight, and other information, and ensure the authenticity, accuracy, and completeness of the declared information. All consequences and costs caused by the US Customs re-evaluation, detention, delay, confiscation, supplementary tax payments, and additional fines will be borne by the sender. Once your company delivers the goods, it will be deemed that you have carefully read and defaulted to abide by the above notice!

Affected by this policy, for the goods/packages you entrust, our company will indefinitely collect US import taxes and fees from you. We will update synchronously if there are any policy updates, thank you for your understanding!
