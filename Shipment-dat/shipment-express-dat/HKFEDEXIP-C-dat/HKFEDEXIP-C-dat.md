**Special instructions:**

1.  For shipments to "EU countries", an EORI number is required for normal transit. In order to avoid delays in shipments, please make sure that you have this EORI number before shipping (the EORI number is a registration number that is essential for companies with economic activities, especially import and export business, in EU countries. You must register with the customs of the country where the company is located to obtain this number, which can be used throughout the EU.) For example: France and Germany need to provide EORI number; private addresses do not need to provide EORI number.
2.  For packages sent to Italy, Germany, and France, if the recipient is a private individual, the shipper must declare a valid recipient tax number (a tax number consisting of 16 digits or characters) on the waybill and accompanying invoice. Please be aware and inform the shipper that before shipping the goods, be sure to ensure that the information is correct and complete. If the above regulations are not followed, the shipment may be delayed or forcibly returned to the place of shipment or destroyed by the local customs. The shipper will not be notified separately before the return or destruction, and all delays and expenses incurred will be borne by the shipper.

1.  Please pack fragile items yourself, otherwise we will not be responsible for breakage. If loss, breakage, or compensation occurs during the transportation of the goods, the declared value stated on the commercial invoice (or proforma invoice) provided by the sender with the goods will be used as a reference for the compensation value. Compensation will be made for the actual loss or damage, but the maximum compensation amount per ticket shall not exceed 100 US dollars. We shall not be liable for any consequential losses caused by the loss, damage or delay of the express mail. If customers have additional requirements, they can purchase cargo insurance by themselves.
2.  We will not recognize any cargo value provided by the shipping company after the loss or damage event that is different from the declared value stated on the original commercial invoice (or proforma invoice) accompanying the cargo.
3.  Please report to our company and issue a written claim letter within 10 days from the date of the incident, otherwise it will not be accepted.

**About 2025 Tariff Requirements**

**Reminder on documents for goods to the United States and Puerto Rico:**

*   #. The document is not affected;
*   #. MID is not required for direct shipment below 250USD;
*   #. MID is required for shipment between 250-800 US dollars (regardless of whether it is declared or not), and the IOR of goods of this value is currently not required;
*   #. For declared goods above 800 US dollars, the importer tax number and MID must be provided for shipment.

Because the United States has cancelled the 800 US dollar threshold, all goods may be subject to tariffs. Please be sure to provide accurate product names, ingredients, HS Codes and other information when preparing the documents.

**About MID:**

MID Code (Manufacturer Identification Code) is mainly used for US customs declaration and is an alternative code for the full name and address of the manufacturer, shipper or exporter. The following are the rules for generating the MID Code:

1.  Country code
    *   Use the two-letter ISO code of the supplier's country. For example:
        *   GB: United Kingdom
2.  Company name
    *   Take the first three letters of the first two "words" in the company name. For example:
        *   ABC Company → ABC
        *   L.S. Ayres Company → LSA
        *   If there is no obvious word separation in the company name, take the first six letters.
3.  Address number
    *   Extract the largest number from the address line, up to four digits. For example:
        *   236 Wendell Ford Blvd → 236
        *   1234 Main Street → 1234
        *   49 250th St → 49
4.  City name
    *   Take the first three letters of the city name. For example:
        *   St. Louis → STL
        *   London → LON

**Example**

Suppose a manufacturer has the following details:

*   Company Name: ABC Company
*   Address: 236 Wendell Ford Blvd, Ste 1304
*   City: Erlanger
*   Country: United States

The process of generating its MID Code is as follows:

1.  Country code: US
2.  Company Name: ABC
3.  Address number: 236
4.  City name: ERL

The final generated MID Code is: USABC236ERL.

**Precautions**

*   The MID Code must be generated accurately according to the above rules, otherwise the customs documents may be returned.
*   For some special cases (such as Canada), provincial codes may need to be used.
*   If the address contains multiple numbers, the largest number should be selected.

**Urgent Notice on Changes to US Tariff Policy ‼‼**

*   On February 1, 2025, the U.S. government issued an executive order announcing a 10% tariff increase on all goods from China. The new regulations will take effect on February 4, 2025. All goods from China to the United States will no longer enjoy the tariff exemption policy below 800 US dollars, and will be subject to an additional 10% tariff on the original tax rate (the final tariff for various products ranges from 10-60% or more).
*   At the same time, please also ask all customers to fill in the cargo information truthfully when shipping, including but not limited to product name, amount, quantity, HS Code of the destination country, weight and other information, and ensure the authenticity, accuracy and completeness of the declared information. If the U.S. Customs re-evaluates the value and causes customs detention, delays, confiscation, payment of supplementary taxes and additional fines, all consequences and expenses will be borne by the sender. Once your company delivers the goods, it will be deemed that you have carefully read and defaulted to abide by the above notice!

    1.  US HS Code query website: htps://rulings.cbp.gov/home
    2.  US tariff rate query website: https://hts.usitc.gov/

*   Affected by this policy, for the goods/packages you entrust, our company will indefinitely collect additional US import taxes and fees from you. We will update any policy updates synchronously, thank you for your understanding!
