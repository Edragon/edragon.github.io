âœ… Their Relationship:
Fluorescence is usually excited by ultraviolet light.

For example:

Certain minerals, clothes, highlighters, and nail polish will emit bright colors under a UV light; this is fluorescence.

You cannot see ultraviolet light itself, but when it shines on fluorescent substances, you can see colors.

ðŸ§ª Analogy for Understanding:
It's like striking a bell (ultraviolet light) â†’ the bell sounds (fluorescence)
Ultraviolet light provides the energy, and fluorescence is the visible light "emitted" by the substance after being excited.

âœ… Brief Differences:

| Feature         | Fluorescence                      | Ultraviolet (UV)                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| What it is      | A phenomenon (light emission)     | A type of electromagnetic wave (light) |
| Wavelength      | Emits visible light               | Shorter wavelength than visible light, invisible to the naked eye |
| Source          | Needs excitation, e.g., by UV light | Naturally present in sunlight, UV lamps |
| Visibility      | Fluorescence is visible           | UV light is invisible to the naked eye |
