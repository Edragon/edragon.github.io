Common Faults and Solutions

**Z-Axis Cannot Move Up or Down After Reset**

*   **Solution:** The Z-axis can move during reset, but not after, is a protective measure indicating an unsuccessful reset.

**Nozzle Calibration Error**

1.  The nozzle is not in the visual center, and the deviation value is too large. Check the reason why it is not in the visual center, or recalibrate.
2.  The nozzle diameter is entered incorrectly. Try a few parameters near the standard value.
3.  The recognition range is set too large, leading to misidentification. Reduce the range value.

**Feeder Red Light Flashes After Clicking "Forward"**

1.  The tape is blocked and cannot advance. Retract the tape and reload.
2.  The gear is stuck on a component.

**Placement Offset or Rotation**

*   **Individual Component Offset**

    *   Check if the visual image is correct. ðŸ‘ˆ (The green box should just wrap the component and not be too large or too small.)
