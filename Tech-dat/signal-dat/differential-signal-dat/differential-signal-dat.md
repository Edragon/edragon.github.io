## üîç Key Differences: RS-485 vs RS-422

| Feature           | RS-485                 | RS-422                     |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Driver count     | Multiple drivers       | One driver only            |
| Receiver count   | Up to 32 receivers     | Typically up to 10         |
| Duplex mode      | Half or full duplex    | Full duplex (typical)      |
| Biasing required | ‚úÖ Yes (often)         | ‚ùå Not usually needed       |
| Termination      | ‚úÖ Yes (120Œ©)          | ‚úÖ Yes (120Œ©)              |

### üß† MAX490 in RS-422 Setup

- The **MAX490 can act as the driver or receiver** in an RS-422 setup.
- Ensure only **one driver is active** on the bus.
- Communication is **half-duplex only**, due to MAX490 design.
- For full-duplex RS-422, use a different transceiver (e.g., MAX491).

## MAX490 for RS422 


| Feature                     | RS-422 (with MAX490)             | Notes                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Driver                     | 1 (only one MAX490 TX active)    | Matches RS-422 spec                  |
| Receiver                   | Up to 32 (MAX490 supports 32 RX) | RS-422 typically supports 10         |
| Termination needed         | ‚úÖ Yes                            | 120 Œ© between A and B                |
| Biasing resistors needed   | ‚ùå Usually not                    | Optional; only if line floats        |
| Duplex Mode                | **Half-duplex only**             | MAX490 can't do full-duplex RS-422   |

#### ‚úÖ Termination Resistor:
- Use a **120 Œ©** resistor between A and B at the **end of the cable**.

#### ‚ùå Biasing Resistors:
- **Not required** in RS-422 because the single driver maintains a known state.
- Optional if you observe floating voltages or noise.



## Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors for MAX490 (RS-485)

The **MAX490** is a differential RS-485/RS-422 transceiver. While it does not require internal pull-up or pull-down resistors, **external resistors are typically used for bus biasing** to ensure known voltage levels when no device is actively driving the bus.

### ‚úÖ When Are They Needed?

- When no device is guaranteed to drive the RS-485 bus (e.g., during idle periods).
- To avoid undefined logic levels on the differential lines A and B.
- Especially important in **multi-drop** configurations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Biasing Setup

Typical resistor values:

- **Pull-up on A**: 680 Œ© to +5V
- **Pull-down on B**: 680 Œ© to GND
- **Termination resistor**: 120 Œ© between A and B (at both ends of the bus)

### üîç Notes

- MAX490 includes **receiver failsafe** features, but **external biasing is still standard practice**.
- In **point-to-point** setups, biasing might be optional but is still recommended for stability.
- In **multi-drop** (multi-device) RS-485 networks, biasing is essential for reliable communication.
