## Types of Buzzers

### Active Buzzer
An active buzzer has a built-in oscillator, allowing it to produce sound when powered with a DC voltage. It is simple to use and does not require an external signal.

- **Features**:
  - Built-in oscillator
  - Produces a fixed tone
  - Easy to use (plug-and-play)
  - Requires only DC voltage to operate

- **Applications**:
  - Alarms
  - Timers
  - Simple sound notifications

### Passive Buzzer
A passive buzzer requires an external oscillating signal to produce sound. It offers more flexibility, allowing you to control the tone and frequency.

- **Features**:
  - Requires an external signal (e.g., square wave)
  - Fully customizable sound (tone, frequency, duration)
  - Controlled via microcontrollers or signal generators

- **Applications**:
  - Musical projects
  - Custom sound patterns
  - Advanced sound notifications
