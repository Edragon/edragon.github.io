REED RELAY - A reed relay is an electromagnetic switch that uses a magnetic field to control a reed switch. It consists of a coil wrapped around a hermetically sealed glass capsule containing two ferromagnetic reeds. When the coil is energized, it creates a magnetic field that pulls the reeds together, closing the circuit, while a spring force separates them when the coil is de-energized. Reed relays are known for their speed, long life, and ability to switch low-level signals with high reliability.
