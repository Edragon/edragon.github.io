| Pump Type        | Pressure Ability           | Flow Rate | Advantages                             | Disadvantages                             | Suitability for Water Gun                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Diaphragm Pump   | High (can make strong jet) | Medium    | Self-priming, good pressure, portable  | Noisy, limited flow                       | ✅ Best choice for high-pressure water gun   |
| Peristaltic Pump | Very Low                   | Very Low  | Clean fluid path, precise dosing       | Very weak flow and pressure               | ❌ Not suitable                              |
| Submersible Pump | Low (mostly free flow)     | High      | Large continuous flow, simple design   | Cannot build strong jet, only steady flow | ⚠️ Suitable only for fountain-like spraying  |
| Jet Pump         | Medium to High             | Medium    | Can lift and pressurize water, durable | Less efficient, higher power demand       | ✅ Possible, but more complex than diaphragm |


- A **self-priming pump** is a type of centrifugal/impeller pump designed to lift water automatically.  
- A **diaphragm pump** uses a flexible membrane, usually for higher pressure but lower flow, and can handle more challenging fluids.  

#### Jet pumps

Jet pumps usually do not belong to diaphragm pumps, peristaltic pumps, or submersible pumps.

Their classification is:

A jet pump (also called an ejector pump) belongs to the jet pump category, which relies on a high-speed jet of fluid to create negative pressure for suction and liquid delivery.

Unlike diaphragm pumps and peristaltic pumps, it has no elastic diaphragm or tube-squeezing mechanical structure.

Unlike submersible pumps, it does not rely on an impeller for direct pressurization, but instead uses the nozzle jet principle.
