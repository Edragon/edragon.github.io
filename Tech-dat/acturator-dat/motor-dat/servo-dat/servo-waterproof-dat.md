If you want to use a **servo underwater** and keep it fully waterproof, follow these strategies:

---

## 1. Use a Waterproof Servo
- **Buy a commercially waterproof servo** (used in RC boats, submarines, cars).  
- These servos are **internally sealed** with rubber gaskets around the motor and gears.  
- Check the **IP rating**: IP68 is ideal for full submersion.

---

## 2. Encapsulation in a Waterproof Housing
If the servo is not inherently waterproof:  
- **Housing:** Use a small **aluminum, plastic, or acrylic canister**.  
- **Sealing methods:**  
  - **O-rings** at openings (shaft, wires).  
  - **Epoxy or silicone sealant** for gaps.  
- **Cable entry:** Use **watertight cable glands**.  
- **Pressure:** For deep water, the housing must resist **external water pressure** (e.g., 10 m ≈ 1 atm; 100 m ≈ 10 atm).

---

## 3. Lubrication and Corrosion Protection
- Apply **marine grease** on gears to prevent rust.  
- Prefer **stainless steel or plastic gears**.  
- Avoid motors sensitive to water (like uncoated brushed motors).

## 5. Pressure Considerations
- At **deep depths** (>50 m), water pressure can crush the servo or housing.  
- Housing must be **strong enough** (aluminum or thick acrylic).  
- Calculate **wall thickness** using:  

    P=ρgh, then choose a material with a safety factor.

✅ Tip: For shallow water RC boats or ROVs (<10 m), many servos with proper epoxy coating or silicone sealing work. For deeper submersion, you almost always need a sealed housing or a servo designed for underwater use.
