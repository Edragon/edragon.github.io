## how to prevent motor burning

- Don‚Äôt run **96 kHz** unless you‚Äôre sure your ESC can handle it.  
- Set **Motor Idle Throttle ~6%** to prevent stalling.  
- Keep an eye on **motor temperature after indoor flights** (touch test). Warm = ok, too hot to touch = dangerous.  
- Avoid flying with props bent / rubbing ducts indoors (adds load).  

## What Does 1400KV Mean in an FPV Motor?

In FPV drones, **KV** is a motor specification that indicates the motor‚Äôs speed constant.  

---

### ‚ö° Definition of KV
- **KV (RPM/Volt)** = How many **Revolutions Per Minute (RPM)** the motor will spin **per 1 Volt applied**, without any load (no propeller).  

For example:  
- A **1400KV motor** spins **1400 RPM per Volt**.  
- If powered by a **4S LiPo (14.8 V)**:  
  
    1400 KV √ó 14.8 V ‚âà 20,720 RPM (no load)

### üîß What It Means in Practice

1. **Lower KV (e.g., 1400KV)**
 - Spins slower per volt.
 - Provides more **torque** (good for larger props, longer flight times, heavy drones, cinewhoops).
 - Better for **efficiency** and carrying loads.

2. **Higher KV (e.g., 2800KV, 4000KV)**
 - Spins faster per volt.
 - Provides less torque, but more **speed**.
 - Good for **small props, racing, and high agility**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Typical Use Cases
- **1400KV motors** are usually found on:
- **Cinewhoops** with 3‚Äì5 inch props.
- **Long-range FPV drones** where efficiency and endurance matter.
- Drones designed to carry heavier cameras (e.g., GoPro).

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**:  
A **1400KV FPV motor** means the motor spins about **1400 RPM per volt** (unloaded). It is a **low-KV motor** designed for **larger props, more torque, and efficiency**, rather than raw speed.
