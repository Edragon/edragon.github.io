# Thrust-dat

A bit of math:

Mobula motors + props making around 90-100g of thrust at 50%

Mobula8 weight around 110g with battery 550 mah An ok-ish ratio of thrust to weight is 4:1

Thrust/(camweight+drone weight)

400 / (16+110)= 3.17...

Hence to have a proper flight you'll have to be above 50% throttle most of the time.

It might fly pretty stable with proper PID tuning and filtering but your batteries will burn (maybe even literally)
