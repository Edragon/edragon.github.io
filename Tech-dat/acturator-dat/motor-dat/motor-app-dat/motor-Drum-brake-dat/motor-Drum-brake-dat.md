A drum-brake motor is an electric motor that has a built-in electromagnetic brake.
The brake is shaped like a drum, similar to how drum brakes work on cars.

⭐ Key idea

When the motor loses power, the brake automatically locks, stopping the motor shaft from rotating.

When the motor is powered, the brake releases, allowing the motor to spin normally.
