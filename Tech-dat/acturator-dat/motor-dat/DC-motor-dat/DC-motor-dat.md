## 130 Motor Overview

The **130 motor** is a type of **DC motor** commonly used in toys, small appliances, and DIY electronics projects.

### üîß Type

- **Type:** Permanent Magnet Brushed DC Motor
- **Category:** Small-size DC Motor

### ‚öôÔ∏è Specifications (Typical)

- **Voltage Range:** 1.5V ‚Äì 6V (Commonly 3V or 5V) ??? try up to 7V 
- **High RPM:** Often from a few thousand to over 10,000 RPM
- **Low Torque:** Suitable for light-load applications
- **Brush Type:** Brushed (uses carbon brushes and a commutator)


## 230 Motor Overview

The **230 motor** is a small **DC motor**, similar in design to the 130 motor but typically **larger in size and power**.

### üîß Type

- **Type:** Permanent Magnet Brushed DC Motor
- **Category:** Medium-size DC Motor

### ‚öôÔ∏è Specifications (Typical)

- **Voltage Range:** Often 3V ‚Äì 12V
- **Higher Torque and Power** than 130 motor
- **Medium RPM** (usually lower than 130 motor, but stronger)
- **Brush Type:** Brushed (uses carbon brushes)

## Why Is It Called a "230 Motor"?

The name **"230 motor"** comes from an informal naming convention based on the **size of the motor case**, not the voltage or power.

### üìê Meaning of "230"

- **"2"** = Series or form factor group
- **"30"** = Approximate **length of the motor case in millimeters** (~30 mm)

So, a **230 motor** typically has:
- **Diameter:** ~24 mm
- **Length:** ~30 mm
