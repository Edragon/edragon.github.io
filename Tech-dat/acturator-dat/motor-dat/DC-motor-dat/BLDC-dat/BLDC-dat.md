BLDC stands for Brushless DC Motor. It is a type of electric motor that operates without brushes, unlike traditional brushed DC motors. BLDC motors are more efficient, durable, and generate less noise because they use electronic commutation instead of mechanical brushes.

Key Features of BLDC Motors:

- Higher Efficiency: Less energy loss compared to brushed motors.
- Longer Lifespan: No brushes mean less wear and tear.
- Low Maintenance: No brush replacements needed.
- Better Speed Control: Precise control using electronic circuits.
- Less Heat & Noise: Smooth operation with minimal friction.

Common Applications:

- Electric Vehicles (EVs)
- Drones
- Cooling Fans
- Air Conditioners
- Power Tools
- Industrial Automation
