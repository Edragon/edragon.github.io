An **EDF motor** is an **electric motor used to drive a ducted fan (EDF)**, which is a type of propulsion commonly used in RC jets and small UAVs.

## 1. What is an EDF?

- **EDF** = **Electric Ducted Fan**  
- Consists of **a fan or multiple blades enclosed in a cylindrical duct**  
- The duct **improves thrust efficiency** and reduces tip losses compared to an open propeller  
- The motor spins the fan to generate **thrust** for forward flight

---

## 2. EDF Motor Function

- Powers the fan inside the duct  
- Converts **electrical energy** (from battery) into **rotational motion**  
- Higher RPM → more thrust, smaller fan diameter  
- Typical RC EDF motors: **brushless outrunner motors** for efficiency and power
