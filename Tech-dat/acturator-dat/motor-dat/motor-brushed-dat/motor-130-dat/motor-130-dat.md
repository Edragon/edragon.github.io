## info 

A **130 motor** is a standard miniature **brushed DC motor** widely used in toys, small robots, DIY electronics, and gearboxes. The "130" refers to the **size/form factor**, not a specific model. These motors are often interchangeable between brands.

**Common Applications:**
- Small wheeled robots
- Toy cars and fans
- Mini pumps
- DIY electronics and STEM projects

## Operating Notes
- Current draw increases with load; low at no-load, very high at stall.
- Motors can overheat or burn if voltage exceeds rated value.
- Use a motor driver or PWM control for speed regulation and safe operation.
- Typical operating temperature: –10°C to +60°C
