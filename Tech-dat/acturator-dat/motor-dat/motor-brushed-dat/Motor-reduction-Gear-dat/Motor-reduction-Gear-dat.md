## Planetary Gear Motor vs. Normal Reduction Gear Motor Comparison

| Feature                | Planetary Gear Motor                                | Normal Reduction Gear Motor (Spur/Parallel Shaft)      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gear Structure**     | Sun gear, planet gears, and ring gear in a concentric design | Simple parallel or linear gear train                     |
| **Torque Capacity**    | High torque output for compact size                 | Lower torque for same size                              |
| **Efficiency**         | High, due to multiple gear contacts and load distribution | Moderate to low, depending on gear stages               |
| **Size/Compactness**   | Very compact and space-efficient                    | Larger footprint for equivalent performance             |
| **Load Distribution**  | Load shared across multiple planet gears            | Load typically carried by one gear pair                 |
| **Noise Level**        | Lower noise and vibration                           | Can be noisy, especially under heavy load               |
| **Smoothness**         | Smooth and stable operation                         | May exhibit more vibration                              |
| **Durability**         | Durable due to even load and better balance         | Wear can occur faster on specific gear sets             |
| **Cost**               | Higher due to complex design and tighter tolerances | Lower manufacturing cost                                |
| **Maintenance**        | Slightly more complex due to enclosed design        | Easier to service or replace parts                      |
| **Applications**       | Robotics, CNC, automotive transmissions, solar trackers | Basic machinery, conveyors, household devices           |

## Definitions 

⚙️ A DC motor that has a gearbox (gear reduction unit) attached to it — usually on the output shaft.


### 🔧 Why Use a Gear Motor?

| Feature                | Effect                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lower speed (RPM)**  | The gearbox reduces the motor’s high speed          |
| **Higher torque**      | Gear reduction increases torque at the output shaft |
| **Better control**     | Easier to manage at low speeds (no stalling)        |
| **Compact design**     | All-in-one motor + gearbox in one body              |

---

### 🔁 Example:

- A regular DC motor might spin at **6000 RPM**
- With a **50:1 gear ratio**, the output becomes **~120 RPM**, but with ~50× more torque (minus losses)


If your 895 motor lacks torque even with a gearbox, consider:

- High-torque 24V–36V gear motors, 300W–1000W
- Brands: **Zhenlong**, **MY1016**, **E-Tek**

**Use**: Robotics, automation, e-mobility, conveyor systems
