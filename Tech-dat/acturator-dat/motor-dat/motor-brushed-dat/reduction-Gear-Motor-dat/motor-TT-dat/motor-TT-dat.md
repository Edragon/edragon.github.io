## Key features mentioned include:

- Gearbox: It typically has a plastic gearbox, often with a 1:48 or 1:120 gear ratio.
- Voltage: Operates at voltages like 3V, 5V, or 6V.
- Current:
  - No-load current is around 150mA at 3V and 170mA at 6V.
  - Stall current can be around 0.8A at 3V and up to 1.3A or 2.8A at 6V depending on the specific model.
- Speed: No-load speed varies with voltage and gear ratio (e.g., 90-100 RPM at 3V, 180-250 RPM at 6V).
- Torque: Stall torque is also voltage and gear ratio dependent (e.g., 0.8 kg.cm).
- Shaft: Often has a dual shaft design.
- EMF: Some versions may have built-in electromagnetic shielding or capacitors for EMF suppression.
