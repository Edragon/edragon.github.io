note the rated torque of a motor is the maximum torque that the motor can deliver at its rated speed.

and stall torque is the maximum torque that the motor can deliver at zero speed.

## Torque 

Meaning:

Torque = Force Ã— Distance from the axis of rotation

10 NÂ·m means a force of 10 Newtons is applied 1 meter away from the pivot point (or 5 N applied 2 meters away, etc.).


## Newtons 

ðŸ§± Real-World Examples of 10 N:

Lifting about 1 kg vertically against Earth's gravity.

Gravity exerts about 9.8 N of force on a 1 kg object.

So if you lift a 1-liter bottle of water (which weighs about 1 kg), you're applying roughly 10 N of force.



## ðŸ”„ What is 100 kgfÂ·cm?

kgf = kilogram-force

This is the force exerted by 1 kg of mass due to gravity (â‰ˆ 9.80665 newtons).

cm = centimeters, the distance from the axis of rotation.

So 100 kgfÂ·cm means:

The torque generated by **a 100 kgf force acting 1 cm away from the axis**, or a 1 kgf force acting 100 cm away, and so on.
