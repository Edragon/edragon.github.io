note the rated torque of a motor is the maximum torque that the motor can deliver at its rated speed.

and stall torque is the maximum torque that the motor can deliver at zero speed.

## Torque 

Meaning:

Torque = Force × Distance from the axis of rotation

10 N·m means a force of 10 Newtons is applied 1 meter away from the pivot point (or 5 N applied 2 meters away, etc.).


## Newtons 

🧱 Real-World Examples of 10 N:

Lifting about 1 kg vertically against Earth's gravity.

Gravity exerts about 9.8 N of force on a 1 kg object.

So if you lift a 1-liter bottle of water (which weighs about 1 kg), you're applying roughly 10 N of force.



## 🔄 What is 100 kgf·cm?

kgf = kilogram-force

This is the force exerted by 1 kg of mass due to gravity (≈ 9.80665 newtons).

cm = centimeters, the distance from the axis of rotation.

So 100 kgf·cm means:

The torque generated by **a 100 kgf force acting 1 cm away from the axis**, or a 1 kgf force acting 100 cm away, and so on.

## compare 100 kgf·cm and 10 N·m

#### 🔁 Conversion
- 1 kgf·cm = 0.0980665 N·m, 100 centimeters (cm) is equal to 1 meter (m).
- 100 kgf·cm = 100 × 0.0980665 = **9.80665 N·m**

#### ✅ Comparison Table

| Unit         | Value in N·m        |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 100 kgf·cm   | ≈ 9.81 N·m           |
| 10 N·m       | 10.00 N·m            |

#### 📌 Conclusion
- **100 kgf·cm ≈ 9.81 N·m**, slightly less than **10 N·m**
- Difference: **~0.19%**
- For practical purposes: **Nearly equal**
