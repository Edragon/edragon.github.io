‚öôÔ∏è A DC motor that has a gearbox (gear reduction unit) attached to it ‚Äî usually on the output shaft.


### üîß Why Use a Gear Motor?

| Feature                | Effect                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lower speed (RPM)**  | The gearbox reduces the motor‚Äôs high speed          |
| **Higher torque**      | Gear reduction increases torque at the output shaft |
| **Better control**     | Easier to manage at low speeds (no stalling)        |
| **Compact design**     | All-in-one motor + gearbox in one body              |

### üîÅ Example:

- A regular DC motor might spin at **6000 RPM**
- With a **50:1 gear ratio**, the output becomes **~120 RPM**, but with ~50√ó more torque (minus losses)


If your 895 motor lacks torque even with a gearbox, consider:

- High-torque 24V‚Äì36V gear motors, 300W‚Äì1000W
- Brands: **Zhenlong**, **MY1016**, **E-Tek**

**Use**: Robotics, automation, e-mobility, conveyor systems
