## specs 

Internal parameters of the motor
- Inductance: 4.45mH
- Back electromotive force coefficient (Ke): 0.00103V/rpm
- Armature resistance: 2.3Q ± 0.5
- Electromagnetic torque coefficient (KT): 0.00984Nm/A

Note: Ke and Kt are the parameters of the motor itself (without reduction gearbox). When using, they need to be multiplied by the corresponding reduction ratio of the motor.
