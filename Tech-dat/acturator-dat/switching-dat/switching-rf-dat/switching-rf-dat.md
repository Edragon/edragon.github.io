The ADRF5019 is a nonreflective, single pole, double throw (SPDT) RF switch manufactured in a silicon process.

The ADRF5019 operates from 100 MHz to 13 GHz with better than 0.8 dB insertion loss and 45 dB of isolation at 8 GHz. The ADRF5019 has a nonreflective design, and the RF ports are internally terminated to 50 Ω.
