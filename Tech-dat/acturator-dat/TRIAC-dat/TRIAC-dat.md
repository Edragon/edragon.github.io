## TRIAC
A TRIAC is a bidirectional, three-electrode AC switch that allows electrons to flow in either direction. 
It is the equivalent of two SCRs connected in a reverse-parallel arrangement with gates connected to each other. A TRIAC is triggered into conduction in both directions by a gate signal like that of an SCR.

## SCR 

SCR stands for Silicon Controlled Rectifier. It is a three-terminal device that is used to control the flow of current.

## intro of triac 

A TRIAC (Triode for Alternating Current) is a type of semiconductor device that is used to control the flow of electrical power. It is essentially a bidirectional thyristor, meaning it can conduct current in both directions when triggered, making it particularly useful for AC (alternating current) applications.

### Key points about TRIAC:

- Bidirectional: Unlike a regular thyristor (which only conducts in one direction), a TRIAC can control the current flow in both directions, making it ideal for AC power control.
- Triggering: It can be triggered by a small current applied to its gate, after which it allows current to pass through it until the current drops below a certain threshold.
- Applications: TRIACs are commonly used in light dimmers, motor speed controls, and other devices where AC power needs to be modulated.

In short, a TRIAC is a specific type of thyristor designed for efficient AC power control.
