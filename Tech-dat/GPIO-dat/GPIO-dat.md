GPIOS (Giant Pixel Interleaved Octal Shifts) is a method used in data storage and transfer used in several of Texas Instruments DSP chips. In these chips, the Gpio mode is used for general purpose applications. Here are some of the common GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) modes:

1. PP (Push-Pull): In this mode, the output pins are in a high impedance state and provide a high drive current when being driven.
2. TP (Open-Drain/Sink): In this mode, the output pins are in a low state, and they sink a current when being driven. This mode is useful for interfacing with open drain outputs or and gates.
3. In (Input): The GPIO pin is used simply as an input to the device and any connected module.
4. POI (Pull-Up Resistor In): In this mode, the cable noise can be filtered out by the internal pull-up resistors while the device is running.
5. POPI (Pull-Up Resistor/Pull-Down Input): It's a versatile option that provides isolation for both inputs and outputs
