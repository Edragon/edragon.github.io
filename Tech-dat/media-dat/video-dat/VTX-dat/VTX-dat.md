### 4. RF Output / Matching Components
- **Discrete components**: Inductors, capacitors, microstrip traces for impedance matching (50 Œ©).
- Sometimes **MMCX / U.FL / SMA connector ICs** for external antennas.

---

### üí° Notes
- Many **modern VTX modules** combine RF PA + PLL + video input + microcontroller in a **single small IC or module**, like those found on Mobula8.  
- High-end HD digital VTX (DJI, Walksnail) use **custom ASICs** rather than discrete PA chips.  
- For typical analog 5.8 GHz micro drones: MAX1476/MAX2606 + LMH1980 + STM8 is a very common combo.


## FAQ 

### Running a 1 W Analog VTX for Extended Periods

1. **Heat**
- 1 W VTX produces significant heat.
- On tiny drones like the Mobula8, heat can **damage the VTX, FC, or battery** if there‚Äôs poor airflow.
- Risk increases in warm indoor environments.

2. **Battery Drain**
- 1 W output draws **more current**, reducing flight time significantly.
- Tiny cinewhoops may overheat their small LiPo packs if flown at full power for long periods.

3. **Legal Limits**
- Many regions **restrict 5.8 GHz analog power** (often max 25‚Äì600 mW).
- Flying 1 W indoors or near populated areas could **violate regulations**.

4. **Interference**
- High-power VTX can **interfere with nearby electronics** and even your own control link.
- On tiny drones, the ELRS RX is very close to the VTX, so interference risk is higher.

5. **Practical Recommendation**
- For **indoor flying**: 25‚Äì100 mW is sufficient.
- For **small outdoor fields**: 200‚Äì400 mW is usually enough.
- Only use 1 W for **long-range outdoor FPV** with proper cooling and larger drones.

### ‚úÖ Summary
- Running 1 W for hours is **possible**, but not recommended on micro drones due to **heat, battery drain, and interference risks**.  
- Stick to lower VTX power for safe and reliable indoor/outdoor use.






## what is the VTX in FPV?

- VTX = video transmitter, the device that transmits the video signal from the drone to the goggles or monitor.
- AIO = all in one, a flight controller that integrates multiple components into a single unit, including the flight controller, ESC (electronic speed controller), and sometimes the VTX.
- smart audio = a feature that allows you to control the VTX settings (such as frequency and power) from the flight controller or goggles, without needing to access the VTX directly.
- IRC Tramp = a type of smart audio protocol used by some VTXs, allowing for remote control of the VTX settings.

- TBS UNIFY PRO 32 HV V2 = a high-voltage version of the TBS UNIFY PRO 32 VTX, which supports higher power output and is designed for use with high-voltage battery systems.
