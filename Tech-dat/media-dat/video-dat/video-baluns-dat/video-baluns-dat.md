## 🎥 What is a Video Balun?

A **video balun** is a small device that allows you to transmit **analog video** (like composite CVBS) over **twisted-pair cable** (such as Cat5e or RS-485 wiring), instead of using traditional coaxial cable.

---

### 🧰 What Does a Video Balun Do?

- **"Balun" = BALanced to UNbalanced**
- Converts a **coaxial signal** (unbalanced) into a format suitable for **twisted pair** cable (balanced), and vice versa.
- Allows **standard analog video signals** (e.g., from security cameras) to be sent over inexpensive cabling like Ethernet or alarm wire.

### 🔌 Typical Use Case

| Traditional Setup     | Balun-Based Setup               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Camera → Coax → DVR   | Camera → Video Balun → UTP → DVR |

- One balun at the **camera end**, one at the **DVR end**
- Works with **BNC connectors + RJ45 or screw terminals**

### 📏 How Far Can It Go?

| Quality | Distance (Approx.) | Notes                        |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Standard baluns | ~300 meters (1000 ft) | For CVBS video (no power)     |
| Active baluns   | 600–1200 meters        | Powered, better noise filtering |

---

### 🎯 Benefits

- Use cheap and widely available **Cat5e/6 cables**
- Clean and **less bulky** than coax
- Often supports **multiple video signals** over one cable (4-in-1 baluns)

---

### ⚠️ Limitations

- **Only for analog video** (e.g., CVBS, not HDMI or IP)
- Susceptible to **noise** if low-quality cable or long runs
- May not support high-resolution or color over long distance
