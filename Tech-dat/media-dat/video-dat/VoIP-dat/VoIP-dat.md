## Video over IP Converter

A **Video over IP Converter** is a device that converts analog video signals (e.g., composite, component) into digital video streams that can be transmitted over IP networks. It is commonly used in surveillance, broadcasting, and remote video transmission systems.

### How It Works:
1. The converter takes an **analog video signal** and converts it into a **digital IP stream** (e.g., H.264, MJPEG).
2. The digital stream is transmitted over an **Ethernet network**.
3. At the receiving end, the stream is decoded and can be displayed on monitors or recorded.

### Applications:
- **Surveillance**: Transmitting video signals from analog cameras over a network.
- **Broadcasting**: Transmitting video feeds for live broadcasts or events.
- **Video Conferencing**: Sending video signals for remote meetings.


## Video Over IP (VoIP) Transmission Distance

The **distance** for transferring video over a **Video over IP (VoIP)** solution depends on the type of **network infrastructure** and **bandwidth** of the connection. Here are the key factors that influence the transmission range:

### 1. Ethernet (Copper Cable - Cat5e, Cat6)
- **Maximum Distance:**
  - The standard maximum length for Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6) is **100 meters** (about **328 feet**). Beyond this distance, signal degradation can occur.
- **Solution for Longer Distances:**
  - **Ethernet Extenders**: Extend the distance up to **500 meters** (about **1,640 feet**) or more.
  - **Switches/Repeaters**: Can help extend the signal within the 100-meter range.

### 2. Fiber Optic Cable
- **Maximum Distance:**
  - **Single-mode fiber**: Transmits data over **10-40 kilometers** (about **6-25 miles**) without significant signal loss.
  - **Multi-mode fiber**: Typically transmits data over **300 meters to 2 kilometers** (about **1,000-6,500 feet**).
- **Fiber Advantages:**
  - Provides **higher bandwidth**, **lower latency**, and is immune to **electromagnetic interference**.
