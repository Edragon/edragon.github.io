## NBIOT 

LTE Cat NB1, 

also known as Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) technology that has been developed to enable a wide range of devices to be connected to the internet using existing mobile networks. NB-IoT has been developed to enable the Internet of Things (IoT). It is a low power, narrowband technology that can support small amounts of 2-way data transmission in an efficient, secure, and reliable manner. This standard was created in **3GPP Release 13**.

LTE Cat NB2 

is an upgraded version of the LTE Cat NB1 standard (NB-IoT). **In Release 14**, 3GPP introduced an enhanced NB-IoT protocol and a new device category called NB2. 

This standard is an upgraded version of the LTE Cat NB1 standard.
