Yes, you can insert a bare end POF cable into the Broadcom HFBR-0500 Series transceivers (e.g., HFBR-1521Z, HFBR-2521Z, etc.) — that’s one of their key advantages.

✅ Here's how it works:

The HFBR-0500 series is designed for tool-less, field-installable connections.

You can directly cut and insert a 1 mm core POF cable (typically with 2.2 mm jacket) into the transceiver.

No pre-attached connector is required.
