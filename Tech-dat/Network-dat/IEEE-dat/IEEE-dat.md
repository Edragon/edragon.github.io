**Notes:**

*   **Max Data Rate:** These are theoretical maximums under ideal conditions with the highest configurations (e.g., maximum spatial streams, highest modulation). Real-world speeds are typically lower.
*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   **DSSS:** Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
    *   **FHSS:** Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
    *   **OFDM:** Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
    *   **MIMO:** Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (using multiple antennas)
    *   **MU-MIMO:** Multi-User MIMO (allows simultaneous communication with multiple devices)
    *   **OFDMA:** Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (divides channel for multiple users)
    *   **TWT:** Target Wake Time (improves battery life for IoT devices)
    *   **BSS Coloring:** Reduces interference between neighboring networks
    *   **MLO:** Multi-Link Operation (aggregates multiple bands/channels)
*   **Wi-Fi 6E:** Extends Wi-Fi 6 capabilities into the less congested 6 GHz band.
*   **Wi-Fi 7:** The newest standard, focusing on extremely high throughput, lower latency, and improved reliability, particularly for demanding applications like AR/VR and cloud gaming.

## general 

IEEE standards are technical guidelines and specifications developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). These standards ensure compatibility, safety, and interoperability for a wide range of technologies, including networking, electronics, telecommunications, and power systems.

Some well-known IEEE standards include:
- **IEEE 802.3** (Ethernet)
- **IEEE 802.11** (WiFi)
- **IEEE 754** (Floating-point arithmetic)

IEEE standards are widely adopted globally and play a crucial role in advancing technology and ensuring devices from different manufacturers work together
