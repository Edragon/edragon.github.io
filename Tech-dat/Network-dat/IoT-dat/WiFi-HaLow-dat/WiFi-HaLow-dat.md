## WiFi HaLow (IEEE 802.11ah)

WiFi HaLow is a wireless networking standard based on IEEE 802.11ah, designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It operates in the sub-1 GHz frequency bands, providing several key advantages:

- **Long Range:** Coverage up to 1 kilometer, much farther than traditional WiFi.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Optimized for battery-powered IoT devices.
- **Better Penetration:** Signals can pass through walls and obstacles more effectively.
- **High Device Density:** Supports thousands of devices per access point.

WiFi HaLow is ideal for smart homes, industrial automation, agriculture, and other IoT scenarios where long range and low
