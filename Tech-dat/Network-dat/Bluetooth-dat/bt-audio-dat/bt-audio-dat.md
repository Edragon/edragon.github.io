## bluetooth 5.0 

Bluetooth 5.0 does support longer range but with a 10 meters range this solution clearly does not take advantage of this new feature. Bluetooth 5 announcement did not include any specific about audio improvement, So I had a look at a Bluetooth 5 paper, and audio is mentioned three times:

- Bluetooth 5 introduces the ability to perform periodic data to be broadcast, it’s possible to chain packets and deterministic advertising, which allows scanners together and for each packet to contain a different to synchronicity their scanning for packets with the subset of the whole data set. Schedule of the advertising device. This can be a more power-efficient way to perform scanning and is also likely to pave the way for new uses of Bluetooth LE in connection-less scenarios, such as audio applications
- The Bluetooth 4 channel selection algorithm used in frequency hopping produced only 12 distinct sequences of channels and all packets in a given connection event would use the same channel, which is not optimal for some applications, such as audio. Bluetooth 5 introduced a new channel selection algorithm called channel selection algorithm #2. Hopping sequences are now pseudo random and the distinct sequences which are possible are very large.
- Bluetooth’s advertising extensions feature will pave the way for next-generation beacons, advanced audio applications and more.
