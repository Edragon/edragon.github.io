# LoRaWAN Technology Explained

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a wireless communication technology designed for low-power devices to send small amounts of data over long distances. It is mainly used for IoT (Internet of Things) applications, like smart agriculture, smart cities, and industrial monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Long Range**: Can transmit data up to 10–15 km in rural areas and 2–5 km in cities.  
- **Low Power**: Devices can run for years on small batteries.  
- **Low Data Rate**: Best for sending small packets of data (e.g., sensor readings).  
- **License-Free Bands**: Uses unlicensed radio frequencies (e.g., 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in the U.S.).  
- **Star Network Topology**: Devices communicate with gateways, which forward data to a central server.  

## Common Applications

- **Smart Agriculture**: Monitoring soil moisture, weather conditions, and livestock tracking.  
- **Smart Cities**: Managing streetlights, parking spaces, and waste collection.  
- **Industrial IoT**: Equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and asset tracking.  
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking air quality, water levels, and weather conditions.  

LoRaWAN is widely used because of its long-range, low-power, and cost-effective connectivity for IoT devices.
