## Note 


Note about distance:

If the distance required for far, can be connected to the 1/4 wavelength of the antenna, generally use 50 ohm single conductor, the length of the antenna 315M of about 23cm, 433M of about 17cm;

The position of the antenna has also affected the reception of the module, install the antenna as straight as possible away from the shield, high pressure, and interference sources;
