China has several ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands available for low-power, short-range devices. The primary bands are:

- 470-510 MHz: This is the main band designated for LoRaWAN and other LPWAN technologies in China.
- 779-787 MHz: Another band available for short-range devices.
- 920-925 MHz: This band is also used, though it's narrower than in other regions.
- 433.05-434.79 MHz: The standard 433 MHz ISM band.
- 2.4 GHz: The global 2.4 GHz band is available.
- 5.8 GHz: The global 5.8 GHz band is also available.

For LoRaWAN applications, the 470-510 MHz band is the most significant and widely deployed in China.



## üîê 1. Anti-Theft Tags (EAS ‚Äì Electronic Article Surveillance)

These are common in retail stores to prevent theft. They are **not** RFID but use simpler tech.

- **Frequency:** **8.2 MHz** (RF system, most common)
- **Other types:**
  - **58 kHz** (AM system ‚Äì Acousto-Magnetic)
  - **Radio Frequency (RF):** 8.2 MHz
  - **Microwave:** 2.45 GHz (rare)
