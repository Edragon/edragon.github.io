AGPS, or Assisted Global Positioning System, is a technology that uses information from cellular base stations to provide location data. It's often used in mobile phones and is useful when mobile devices can't connect with GPS satellites or when satellite signals can't penetrate. A-GPS can provide accurate location data even when a reliable connection can't be made with the required number of satellites. 

A-GPS devices determine location coordinates faster than GPS devices because they have better connectivity with cell sites. However, A-GPS locations are slightly less accurate than GPS locations.
