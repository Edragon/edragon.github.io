# Thermal Conductivity Comparison: 1.0 vs 2.3

---

## 1. Concept of Thermal Conductivity
- **Thermal conductivity (k)** is usually measured in W/(m·K).  
- **Higher k → better heat transfer** (heat moves faster).  
- **Lower k → worse heat transfer → better insulation**.

---

## 2. Comparison
- **1.0 vs 2.3:**  
  - 2.3 conducts heat faster than 1.0.  
  - 1.0 has slower heat transfer, so it provides better insulation.

---

## 3. Air as a Reference
- Air: k ≈ 0.024 W/(m·K) (very low, excellent insulation).  
- So both 1.0 and 2.3 are much higher than air.

---

## 4. Choosing Based on Application
- **Need heat dissipation → choose 2.3**  
- **Need insulation → choose 1.0**
