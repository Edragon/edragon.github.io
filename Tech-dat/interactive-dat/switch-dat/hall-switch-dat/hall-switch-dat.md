AH1911/AH1921

ULTRA-LOW POWER DIGITAL OMNIPLOAR HALL-EFFECT SWITCH

https://www.diodes.com/datasheet/download/AH1911.pdf

The AH1911/AH1921 is an ultra-low power digital Omnipolar Hall Effect switch IC from Diodes broad Hall Effect switches family. 

Thanks to the hibernating clocking system, the average supply current is only 1.6Î¼A at 3V, which makes the AH1911/AH1921 perfectly fit battery-powered consumer products, Gas or water meter, smoke detectors and IoT devices. 

The wider range of supply voltage (1.6V to 5.5V) extends battery operating time and supports low voltage system microcontrollers, which provides great flexibility for system design. 

The advanced chopper stabilized design provides superior stability on switch operating point over temperature and supply voltage. The high ESD level up to 6kV helps to improve the system robustness.
