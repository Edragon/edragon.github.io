## GM8283 LVDS Transmitter Overview

The GM8283 is a 28-bit parallel-to-serial LVDS transmitter with pre-emphasis, mainly used for the transmission side in video/image transfer applications. It converts 28-bit parallel LVTTL/LVCMOS data and a reference clock into four channels of serial LVDS data streams and one channel of LVDS sync clock. In each clock cycle, 24 bits of RGB data and 3 bits of control data are transmitted across four LVDS serial channels. The input reference clock frequency ranges from 10MHz to 90MHz, with a maximum total data rate of up to 2520Mbps.

### Internal Modules

- **Serializer**: Loads 28-bit parallel data and, triggered by the multi-phase sync clock generated by the PLL, shifts out the data.
- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**: Generates multi-phase sync clocks for data and clock synchronization.
- **LVDS Driver**: Converts the four serial data streams and one sync clock from the serializer into LVDS signals for output.
- **Enable Module**: In standby mode, shuts down internal module currents to enter low-power state.

### Features

- Programmable data gating control: Clock can sample data on either rising or falling edge via RFC control.
