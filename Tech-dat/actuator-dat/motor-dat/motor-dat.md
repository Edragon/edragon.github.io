## NEMA 23 Motor 

# NEMA 23 Motor Overview

A **NEMA 23** motor is a **stepper motor** with a standard **mounting flange size** defined by the **National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)**. It is widely used in CNC machines, 3D printers, robotics, and automation systems.

## Key Features of NEMA 23 Motor

### 1. Frame Size
- The **NEMA 23** standard specifies that the motor has a **2.3-inch (57.15mm) x 2.3-inch (57.15mm) faceplate size** for mounting.
- The **length of the motor varies**, affecting torque and power output.

### 2. Stepper Type
- Most **NEMA 23 motors are stepper motors**, typically **1.8° per step** (200 steps per revolution), but variations exist.
- Some models have finer step angles (e.g., **0.9° per step**, 400 steps per revolution).

### 3. Torque & Power
- The **torque** varies based on the motor length and current rating, typically ranging from **0.3 Nm to over 3.0 Nm**.
- Higher torque versions are often **longer and require higher current**.

### 4. Voltage & Current
- Operates typically on **12V to 48V** (varies based on driver and application).
- Current ratings range from **2A to 6A per phase**, depending on the winding configuration.

### 5. Shaft & Wiring
- Shaft diameter is usually **6.35mm (1/4 inch) or 8mm**.
- Common wiring configurations: **4-wire, 6-wire, or 8-wire** for unipolar or bipolar operation.

## Common Applications of NEMA 23 Stepper Motors
- **CNC Machines** (milling, laser cutters, engraving machines)
- **3D Printers** (especially for larger or industrial-grade machines)
- **Robotics & Automation Systems**
- **Textile and Packaging Machines**
- **Conveyor Belt Systems**
