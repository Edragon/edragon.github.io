## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance with the formula:

\[ V = I \times R \]

Where:
- \(V\) is the voltage (in volts, V)
- \(I\) is the current (in amperes, A)
- \(R\) is the resistance (in ohms, Î©)

To find the required resistance \(R\), we can rearrange the formula:

\[ R = \frac{V}{I} \]

### Example Calculation

Given the conditions:
- Voltage \(V = 3.3\) V
- Current \(I = 100\) mA = 0.1 A

Substituting into the formula:

\[
R = \frac{3.3}{0.1} = 33 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, to achieve a current of 100 mA with a voltage of 3.3V, the required resistance is **33 ohms**.
