## firmware version 


### slCAN - COM-port based 

SLCAN turns the USB-port into a COM-port and transmits strings on it, so 1-byte data requires 2-bytes to be sent, and additional operations are required to convert strings into data structures. SLCAN can also be connected to SocketCAN, so it’s easy to use.
