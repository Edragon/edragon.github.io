- [[MIPI-CSI-dat]] - [[MIPI-DSI-dat]]

MIPI CSI (Camera Serial Interface) and MIPI DSI (Display Serial Interface) are standardized high-speed interfaces developed by the MIPI Alliance to facilitate efficient communication between components in electronic devices.

### MIPI CSI (Camera Serial Interface):

MIPI CSI is a widely used high-speed protocol for transmitting still and video images from image sensors to application processors. It defines an interface between a camera and a host processor, enabling efficient image data transfer in mobile and embedded systems. The latest version, CSI-2 v3.0, was released in September 2019.

### MIPI DSI (Display Serial Interface):

MIPI DSI defines a high-speed serial interface between a host processor and a display module. It enables manufacturers to integrate displays to achieve high performance, low power, and low electromagnetic interference (EMI) while reducing pin count and maintaining compatibility across different vendors.
