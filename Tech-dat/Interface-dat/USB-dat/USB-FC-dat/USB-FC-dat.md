USB Power Delivery (USB PD) is a fast charging technology that allows devices to negotiate higher power levels over a USB connection. 

Unlike standard USB charging, which is limited to lower voltages and currents, USB PD supports up to 100W (20V, 5A) and dynamically adjusts voltage and current based on device needs. 

This enables rapid charging for smartphones, laptops, and other electronics, while ensuring safety and compatibility. USB PD is commonly used in modern USB-C devices for efficient and flexible charging.

### specifications:

- USB PD supports multiple voltage levels: 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V.
- Current can range from 0.5A up to 5A, depending on the device and cable quality.
- The maximum power output is 100W (20V Ã— 5A).
- Devices negotiate the required voltage and current using a communication protocol over the USB-C connector.
- USB PD allows for bi-directional power flow, meaning either device can supply power.
- Cables must be electronically marked to safely deliver higher currents (above 3A).
- USB PD is backward compatible with standard USB charging but offers much faster charging for supported devices.
