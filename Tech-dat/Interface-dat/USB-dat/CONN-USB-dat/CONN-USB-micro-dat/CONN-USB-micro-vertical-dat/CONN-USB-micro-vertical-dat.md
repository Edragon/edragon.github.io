# CONN-USB-micro-vertical-dat


This connector needs to be soldered on both side to ensure good connection to prevent plug in and out foce. 

this vertical micro usb is easily to loose (10~20% chance) if only back side soldered

add more soldering on the sides to reinforce the connection from the front side too.
