Here are the key advancements introduced with USB 4.0:

- Increased Speed: Offers a maximum data transfer rate of up to 40 Gbps, matching Thunderbolt 3 speeds, by utilizing two lanes. Some configurations might operate at 20 Gbps.
- Thunderbolt 3 Convergence: USB 4.0 integrates the Thunderbolt 3 protocol, making USB 4.0 ports inherently compatible with Thunderbolt 3 devices and cables (though manufacturers must implement and certify this).
- Dynamic Bandwidth Sharing: More efficiently shares bandwidth between data (USB 3.x) and display (DisplayPort) protocols running simultaneously over the same connection. It allocates bandwidth based on need, rather than fixed splitting.
- DisplayPort Alt Mode 2.0: Can support DisplayPort 2.0 over the USB-C connector, enabling higher resolutions and refresh rates for external displays compared to previous versions.
- Mandatory USB Power Delivery (PD): All USB 4.0 implementations must support USB Power Delivery for more robust power negotiation and delivery.
- Backward Compatibility: Maintains backward compatibility with USB 3.2, USB 2.0, and (optionally, but commonly) Thunderbolt 3.
- Exclusive Use of USB Type-C: USB 4.0 is only available through the USB Type-C connector. - [[type-c-dat]]
