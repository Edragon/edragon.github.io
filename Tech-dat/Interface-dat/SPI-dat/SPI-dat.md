| pin  | function | note       |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| CLK  |          | 3-wire SPI |
| MISO |          | 3-wire SPI |

For the SX1262, the NSS pin (chip select) is active low TTL.

Meaning:

- Idle (not selected): NSS = HIGH
- Active (selected): NSS = LOW
- Level logic: 3.3 V high, 0 V low (since SX1262 is a 3.3 V device â€” do not feed it 5 V).

From Semtech SX1262 datasheet:

- NSS is internally pulled high by default.
- Every SPI transaction starts when NSS goes low and ends when NSS goes high.
- All SPI data must be clocked while NSS is low.
