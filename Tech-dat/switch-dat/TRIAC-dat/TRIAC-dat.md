## TRIAC
A TRIAC is a bidirectional, three-electrode AC switch that allows electrons to flow in either direction. 
It is the equivalent of two SCRs connected in a reverse-parallel arrangement with gates connected to each other. A TRIAC is triggered into conduction in both directions by a gate signal like that of an SCR.

## SCR 

SCR stands for Silicon Controlled Rectifier. It is a three-terminal device that is used to control the flow of current.
