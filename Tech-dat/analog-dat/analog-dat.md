## analog video other digital ethernet 

Without full IP conversion, directly transmitting AHD analog video over Ethernet is generally not possible because Ethernet requires digital data.

You can use coax-to-Ethernet converters or serial transmission systems to carry the signal over Ethernet, but these are less common and often provide limited functionality.

Using HD-SDI transmission systems or media converters is another alternative, but it still involves converting the signal into a digital format, although it avoids full IP-based solutions.
