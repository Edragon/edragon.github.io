| **Technology**    | Traditional electret condenser                | Integrated analog microphone with AGC    | MEMS technology (digital)                   |
| **Use Case**      | General-purpose audio recording, comm systems | Voice recording, audio applications      | Portable devices, IoT, consumer electronics |

- **Powering**: ECMs need a bias voltage to function, whereas the MAX9812 and ICS-41434 use internal power supplies (usually lower voltage).
- **Signal Output**: ECMs give an analog output that often requires additional processing, while the MAX9812 provides analog output with built-in gain control, and the ICS-41434 outputs a digital signal (I2S) directly.
- **Technology**: ECMs use a traditional electret condenser design with a FET, while the MAX9812 is an analog microphone with AGC, and the ICS-41434 uses MEMS technology.
