## explaination

A type of radar that uses millimeter-wavelength electromagnetic waves. 

Itâ€™s often used in cars, smart homes, and security systems to detect movement, measure distance, and identify objects.

Can detect animals and pets

This means the radar is sensitive enough to pick up even small living beings like cats or dogs. So it doesn't just detect humans, but also pets.

Works in vehicles even through glass

This means the radar can function inside a car and still detect objects or movement outside or inside, even if there's glass (like car windows or windshields) in the way.
