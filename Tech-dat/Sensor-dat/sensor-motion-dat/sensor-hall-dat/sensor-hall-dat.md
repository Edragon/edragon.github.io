The AB phase encoder (left side of the diagram) outputs two pulse signals, A and B, which are orthogonal (90° out of phase), achieving a fourfold frequency harmonic. The speed measurement accuracy is four times that of a single-pulse encoder.

A single-pulse encoder (right side of the diagram) outputs only one pulse and has lower accuracy than the AB phase encoder. Therefore, for applications requiring high speed measurement accuracy, the AB phase encoder is recommended.
