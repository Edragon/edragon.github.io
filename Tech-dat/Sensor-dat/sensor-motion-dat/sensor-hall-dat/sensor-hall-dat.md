The AB phase encoder (left side of the diagram) outputs two pulse signals, A and B, which are orthogonal (90° out of phase), achieving a fourfold frequency harmonic. The speed measurement accuracy is four times that of a single-pulse encoder.

A single-pulse encoder (right side of the diagram) outputs only one pulse and has lower accuracy than the AB phase encoder. Therefore, for applications requiring high speed measurement accuracy, the AB phase encoder is recommended.




## 49E Linear Hall Effect Sensor

49E linear Hall-effect integrated circuit is based on Hall-Effect principle, which includes a voltage regulator, Hall-voltage generator, linear amplifier, and emitter-follower output stage. The output of the ICs changes linearly with the magnetic flux density that should be measured.



TYPICAL APPLICATION
-  Motion Detector
-  Gear Tooth Sensors
-  Proximity Detector
-  Speed Regulator for Sports Appliance
-  Current Detecting Senso
