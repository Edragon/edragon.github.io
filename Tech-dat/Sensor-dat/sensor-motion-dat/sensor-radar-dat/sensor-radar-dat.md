**A radar sensor** uses radio waves to detect objects, measure their distance, speed, and direction. It works well in various weather and lighting conditions and is commonly used in automotive, industrial, and security applications.

**A lidar sensor** uses laser light to measure distances by emitting pulses and detecting their reflections. It creates high-resolution 3D maps of environments and is widely used in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and mapping. Lidar is more precise for shape and surface detection but can be affected by weather and lighting.
