A TOF (Time-of-Flight) sensor is a device that measures distance by calculating the time it takes for a light signal (usually a laser or LED pulse) to travel to an object and back to the sensor. This technology enables accurate distance measurement, 3D mapping, gesture recognition, and object detection in applications like robotics, smartphones, and industrial automation.
