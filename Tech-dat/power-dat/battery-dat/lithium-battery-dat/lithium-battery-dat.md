## Li-ion VS Li-Poly Battery 

| Feature               | **Li-ion Battery**                                       | **Li-Poly Battery**                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Electrolyte**        | Liquid or gel electrolyte. Requires a hard casing to contain the liquid. Can be more volatile and prone to leakage if damaged. | Solid or gel-like polymer electrolyte. More stable, flexible, and less prone to leakage. |
| **Shape/Size**         | Typically **cylindrical** or **prismatic** in rigid, metal casings. Bulkier design, limiting shape flexibility. | Can be made in **custom shapes** and **sizes**, including thinner, flat, or flexible designs, allowing for more space-efficient configurations. |
| **Weight/Size**        | **Heavier** due to metal casing. Bulkier, typically used for larger devices. | **Lighter** and **more compact** due to the flexible polymer casing, ideal for small, thin devices like smartphones and wearables. |
| **Energy Density**     | Generally **higher energy density**, meaning more power for the same weight and volume. This gives longer battery life in large devices. | **Lower energy density** than Li-ion batteries, meaning slightly shorter battery life per charge, but improvements in technology can minimize this difference. |
| **Durability/Safety**  | **Less durable**; susceptible to damage, leakage, or fire if punctured or overcharged. Requires more protective circuitry to prevent overheating and short circuits. | **More durable and safer**; less prone to leakage, rupture, or combustion. It has a lower risk of damage, making it safer in small, thin devices. |
| **Charging Speed**     | Can **charge faster** due to higher energy density, and faster charging systems are more commonly available. | **Slower charging speed** compared to Li-ion due to higher resistance in the polymer electrolyte, though the difference can be minor depending on the device. |
| **Lifespan**           | Typically lasts **longer** (500-1000 charge cycles), especially for larger applications like laptops, power tools, and electric vehicles. | **Shorter lifespan** (300-500 cycles) compared to Li-ion, though this may be less of an issue in smaller devices or low-drain applications. |
| **Applications**       | Commonly used in **larger, power-demanding devices** such as laptops, electric vehicles, and power tools where higher energy density is a priority. | More often used in **smaller, portable electronics** like smartphones, drones, wearables, and tablets, where compact size and flexibility are important. |
| **Cost**               | **More cost-effective** per unit of energy and storage, especially in larger battery configurations. | **Slightly more expensive** to manufacture due to the polymer design and materials used. |
| **Performance in Extreme Temperatures** | Li-ion batteries generally have a **wider operating temperature range**, but may degrade faster in high or low temperatures. | Li-Poly batteries are more **sensitive to extreme temperatures**, potentially leading to quicker degradation in high heat or low cold, though this can depend on the specific chemistry used. |
| **Environmental Impact** | **Higher environmental impact** due to the complexity of materials and disposal, though efforts are being made for recycling improvements. | Typically **lower environmental impact**, with polymer materials that can be easier to recycle than the metals used in Li-ion batteries. However, both types still have significant environmental concerns. |


## Low Battery Voltage (Below Safe Threshold)

Protection boards are designed to protect lithium batteries from over-discharge, overcharge, and short circuits. Many lithium battery protection circuits cut off the battery's output if the voltage drops below a certain threshold, often around 2.5V to 2.8V.

If the battery is at **2.6V**, it's very close to this cutoff threshold, and the protection circuit may be designed to prevent any further discharge to avoid damaging the battery, which could explain the drop to 0V.
