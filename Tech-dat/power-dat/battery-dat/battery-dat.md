CR2030 provides up to 3V 210~225 mAh, and CR1220 provides up to 3V 38mAh power.

Both button cells provide very low discharge rate that can work for 1-3 years.



## safest battery - Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4)

The safest batteries to use, especially in terms of preventing fires or explosions, are Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries. They are known for their thermal and chemical stability compared to other lithium-ion batteries. Here are some key points about them:

Safety: LiFePO4 batteries are less likely to overheat, catch fire, or explode because of their higher thermal runaway threshold. They also have better stability during overcharging and short-circuit conditions.
Longer lifespan: These batteries tend to last longer than other types, reducing the need for frequent replacements.
Stable chemistry: Their chemical structure is more resistant to thermal changes, which makes them safer even in extreme conditions.
