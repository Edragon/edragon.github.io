# CR1220-dat

The CR1220 is a lithium coin cell battery with the following key features:

Specifications:
- Diameter: 12 mm
- Thickness: 2.0 mm
- Nominal Voltage: 3V
- Capacity: Approximately 35-40 mAh (varies by brand)
- Chemistry: Lithium Manganese Dioxide (LiMnO2)
- Operating Temperature Range: -30°C to +60°C

Common Applications:
- Watches
- Calculators
- Car key fobs
- Small medical devices (like glucose meters)
- Motherboards (for CMOS memory)
- Small toys

Advantages:
- Long Shelf Life: Typically 5-10 years due to low self-discharge rates.
- High Energy Density: Ideal for compact devices.
- Stable Voltage Output: Ensures consistent device operation.


## Pulse Current 

The CR1220 lithium coin cell battery is designed for low-power devices, and its discharge current specifications depend on the manufacturer and application. Here's an overview:

1. Continuous Discharge Current
- Typical Range: 0.1 mA to 0.2 mA
- This current is sufficient for steady operation in devices like watches, calculators, and small sensors.

1. Maximum Pulse Discharge Current
- Typical Range: 1 mA to 5 mA (varies by brand)
- The battery can briefly supply higher currents for short bursts, such as transmitting signals in key fobs or powering small LEDs.

### Important Notes:

Overloading the Battery:

If the discharge current exceeds the specified range for a long time, it may cause:
- Sudden voltage drop
- Reduced capacity
- Battery heating or leakage

Brand Variation:

Manufacturers like Panasonic, Sony, or Maxell may have slightly different specifications for their CR1220 batteries. Always check the datasheet for the specific brand you're using.

### Recommendations:

If your device requires higher discharge currents (e.g., above 10 mA), consider:

Adding a Capacitor: To handle short bursts of high current.
Using a Larger Battery: Such as CR2032 or CR2450, which are better suited for higher-power applications.
