## Measurement 

- [[HLW8012-dat]] - [[HLW8032-dat]]

## Note 

- The live wire of domestic circuits is usually red and is at high voltage. 
- The neutral wire is black and has voltage close to that of the ground. 
- The potential difference between these two wires in India is about 220 V. 
- The earth or ground wire provides safety against faults and current leaks. 
- Earth pin is longer to ensure earth connection happens first while connecting and last while disconnecting any devices.
