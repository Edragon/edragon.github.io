Lasers are widely used in sensors to **measure the shape, distance, or surface profile** of an object.

## üîç How Laser Works as a Sensor

Lasers can be used in sensors through the following key principles:

| Method                   | Principle                                              | What It Measures                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Laser triangulation**  | Measures angle of reflected beam from an object       | Distance, surface profile                  |
| **Time-of-flight (ToF)** | Measures time light takes to reflect back             | Distance (even long-range)                 |
| **Laser scanning**       | Sweeps a laser across an object and records distances | Shape, surface contour, 3D modeling        |
| **Laser interferometry** | Measures phase change of reflected laser light        | Ultra-high precision displacement          |
