## clock generator 

	
[DSC400-1111Q0085KI1-ND == Clock Generator IC 170MHz 1 20-VFQFN Exposed Pad](https://clockworks.microchip.com/microchip/DatasheetsPDF/DSC400-1111Q0085.pdf)

SI5340B-D-GM - Clock Generators & Support Products Ultra low-jitter, 4-output, any-frequency (< 350 MHz), any output clock generator



## prescaler 

2, 4, 8 1.1 GHz Low Power Prescaler with Stand‐By Mode == MC12093

A prescaler is an electronic circuit (or sometimes a counter/divider) that divides the frequency of an input signal by a fixed integer value before passing it on to the next stage.

### 🔧 Key Idea

If you feed in a high-frequency signal (say 1 GHz), and the prescaler is set to ÷10, the output will be 100 MHz.

This makes it easier for slower digital circuits, timers, or microcontrollers to process signals that are otherwise too fast.



## clock buffer 

LMK1C110x 1.8-V, 2.5-V, and 3.3-V LVCMOS Clock Buffer Family

The LMK1C110x is a modular, high-performance, low-skew, general-purpose clock buffer family from Texas Instruments. The entire family is designed with a modular approach in mind. Three different fan-out variations, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, are available.
