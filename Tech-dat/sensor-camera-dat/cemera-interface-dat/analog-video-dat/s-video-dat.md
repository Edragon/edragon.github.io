**S-Video (Separate Video)** is an analog video signal format that transmits video data by separating brightness (**luminance, Y**) and color (**chrominance, C**) into two separate signals. This results in better image quality than composite video (RCA yellow cable), but it is not as good as component video or digital formats like HDMI.

## **How S-Video Works**
- **Luminance (Y):** Transmits brightness (black & white details).  
- **Chrominance (C):** Transmits color information.  
- By keeping these separate, S-Video reduces color bleeding and improves sharpness compared to composite video.

## **S-Video Connector**
- Uses a **4-pin mini-DIN** connector (most common).  
- Some professional versions use a **7-pin or 9-pin** variation.  
- Usually found on **VCRs, DVD players, camcorders, and older TVs**.  

### **Comparison with Other Video Signals**

| **Signal Type**  | **Quality** | **Connector** | **Description** |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Composite**   | Low        | RCA (Yellow) | Single cable for video (blurry, color bleeding). |
| **S-Video**     | Medium     | 4-pin DIN    | Separates brightness & color for better clarity. |
| **Component**   | High       | RCA (Red, Green, Blue) | Even better sharpness & color accuracy. |
| **HDMI**        | Very High  | HDMI         | Digital, best quality, supports audio too. |

## **When to Use S-Video**
- If your device supports S-Video, use it instead of composite for **better image quality**.  
- If converting old tapes or VHS to digital, an **S-Video capture device** will produce **sharper, cleaner video** than composite.
