## 1. Practical Transmission Distance

- **User reports:**  
  - Stable **0.5–1 km** for casual FPV in urban environments.  
  - **Up to 5–7 km** possible in **line-of-sight, open-field conditions** with high-gain antennas.  
- **Realistic expectation:** 1–3 km for consistent video feed with low latency.  
- Beyond 3 km, **signal becomes unstable**; video may freeze or disconnect.



## FAQ 

### 1. Walksnail Avatar / Avatar Kit

- **Direct Phone/Tablet Viewing:** ✅ Yes  
- **How it works:**
