GaAs, MMIC, Fundamental Mixer, 3 GHz to 10 GHz

The HMC787A is a general-purpose, double balanced mixer in a 12-terminal, RoHS compliant, ceramic leadless chip carrier (LCC) package that can be used as an upconverter or downconverter from 3 GHz to 10 GHz. This mixer is fabricated in a gallium arsenide (GaAs), metal semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET) process and requires no external components or matching circuitry.
