- [[PSO1043-dat]] == desoldering pump 

- [[PSO1038-dat]] == desoldering wire (wick)

- [[hot-air-station-dat]]

- [[Hot-Tweezer-dat]]: These are like regular tweezers but with heated tips. They can simultaneously heat and grip small two-leaded SMD components like resistors, capacitors, and SOT packages for easy removal.




| Feature           | Desoldering Wire (Wick)        | Desoldering Pump                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Function**      | Absorbs melted solder          | Sucks up melted solder                  |
| **Best For**      | Small, precise work            | Removing large amounts of solder        |
| **Ease of Use**   | Requires steady hand & flux    | Requires quick reaction & suction       |
| **Effectiveness** | **Good for fine traces & SMD** | **Good for through-hole components**    |
| **Messiness**     | Leaves minimal residue         | Can scatter solder if not used properly |
| **Durability**    | One-time use per section       | Reusable multiple times                 |
| **Cost**          | Cheap, but needs refilling     | More expensive, but reusable            |
| **Skill Level**   | Easier for beginners           | Requires practice to master             |
