## Understanding the Discrepancy

The Compute Module 4 Datasheet uses absolute pin numbering, which is sequential across both connectors (J6 and J7). Here's how it works:

- Pins 1 to 100: Belong to J6 (Connector 1).
- Pins 101 to 200: Belong to J7 (Connector 2).
  
Thus, Pin 164 corresponds to J7-77 (Connector 2, Top Row, Pin 77) when using the relative pin numbering scheme for the J7 connector.

Summary
- HDMI1_CK_P is on J7 (Connector 2).
- Its absolute pin number in the datasheet: 164.
- Its relative pin number on J7: 77.

## pin note 

- 28&29 are ethernet
- 30-33 are Bluetooth
- 34-39 are Wifi (SDIO)
- 40, 41, and 43 are boot rom related.
- 42 is the activity LED
- 44&45 are I2C to the camera and display
- 46&47 are internal control
- 48-53 would appear to configured as SD card, but I believe you're right that they on dedicated pins.
