## can raspberry pi CM4 module work without SD card?

Yes, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) can operate without an SD card because it includes onboard eMMC storage in certain variants. The CM4 is available in two types:

With eMMC storage: If you have a CM4 with onboard eMMC (ranging from 8GB to 32GB), you can boot directly from it, without needing an SD card. You’ll need to flash the operating system to the eMMC storage before use.

Without eMMC storage: If you have a CM4 without eMMC storage, you’ll need to boot from an external storage device. Typically, this can be done through an SD card or, in some cases, USB storage, depending on your carrier board setup and firmware configuration.

So, if your CM4 has eMMC, you can run it without an SD card; otherwise, you’ll need another boot option.


## Minimum External Peripherals Required for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4)

The Raspberry Pi CM4 requires a few basic peripherals to operate. Here’s what you’ll need at a minimum:

### Essential Components

1. **Carrier Board**  
   The CM4 does not have connectors like HDMI, USB, or GPIO pins directly on it, so a carrier board is necessary to access these. For development, the official [Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/) is commonly used. There are also compact third-party carrier boards for different needs.

2. **Power Supply**  
   A stable 5V power supply is essential for the CM4. If using the CM4 IO Board, a USB-C power adapter (5V/3A) is usually suitable.  
   Power requirements may vary depending on the peripherals and modules attached.

3. **Storage (if no eMMC)**  
   If you have a CM4 without onboard eMMC, you’ll need an SD card or an external storage option (such as USB or network boot) to load the operating system.

### Optional but Recommended for Ease of Use

- **HDMI Display and USB Keyboard/Mouse**  
   Useful for direct interaction, especially if setting up the CM4 manually or running a desktop environment.

- **Ethernet (or USB Wi-Fi)**  
   For network access on CM4 variants without onboard Wi-Fi, use a wired Ethernet connection or a USB Wi-Fi dongle. This allows for internet access and SSH setup.


### Summary

At a minimum, you need:
- **Carrier Board**
- **Power Supply**
- **Storage (if no eMMC)**

Additional peripherals depend on your intended setup.
