https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/PDIF

S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface)[1][2] is a type of digital audio interface used in consumer audio equipment to output audio over relatively short distances. The signal is transmitted over either a coaxial cable using RCA or BNC connectors, or a fibre-optic cable using TOSLINK connectors. S/PDIF interconnects components in home theaters and other digital high-fidelity systems.
