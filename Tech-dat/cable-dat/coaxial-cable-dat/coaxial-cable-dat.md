ðŸ”¶ Coaxial (RCA) SPDIF:

- Uses a copper wire inside a coaxial cable.
- Has an RCA connector (looks like those red/white/yellow plugs).
- Carries electrical digital signals.
- Requires a 75-ohm impedance cable for proper SPDIF transmission.


## S/PDIF

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/PDIF

S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface)[1][2] is a type of digital audio interface used in consumer audio equipment to output audio over relatively short distances. The signal is transmitted over either a coaxial cable using RCA or BNC connectors, or a fibre-optic cable using TOSLINK connectors. S/PDIF interconnects components in home theaters and other digital high-fidelity systems.
