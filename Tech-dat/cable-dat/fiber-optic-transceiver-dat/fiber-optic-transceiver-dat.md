## SC module 

SC stands for Subscriber Connector.

SC connectors are a type of fiber optic connector commonly used with fiber optic cables.

### Features:

Push-pull coupling mechanism: Allows easy insertion and removal of connectors.

Duplex design: Typically used in dual-core fiber optic cables (sending and receiving signals).

Durable and reliable, often used in telecommunications, data centers, and other long-distance fiber optic links.

Size: Relatively large compared to other connectors like LC.

## LC module 

LC stands for Lucent Connector.

LC connectors are smaller versions of SC connectors, commonly used in high-density fiber optic applications.

### Features:

Small form factor: Half the size of SC connectors, making them ideal for space-limited environments like data centers.

Latch mechanism: Uses a clip-on design for easy and secure connection.

High-density applications: Commonly used in network switches, routers, and patch panels.

Fiber types: Can be used with both single-mode and multi-mode fibers.
