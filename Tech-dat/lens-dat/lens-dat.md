## lens and oil 

How mineral oil affects lens materials

### ● Glass elements  
Mineral oil **does not damage glass**. No dissolving or warping.

### ● Optical coatings (multi-coatings)  
Mineral oil does **not chemically attack coatings**, but it can leave an **oil film**.  
This causes:
- lower contrast  
- foggy look  
- ghosting  

### ● Optical glue (UV glue / epoxy glue)  
Most lens groups use **epoxy-based optical cement**.  
- Short-term contact: usually **safe**  
- Long-term soaking: may **soften**, **yellow**, or **release stress**

### ● Plastic parts (ABS, PC, nylon)  
Usually **stable** in mineral oil.  
Some plastics may swell after many months.


## lens tuning

### Six keys to maintain clarity after oil immersion

- Use oil with a consistent, stable refractive index
- Avoid any trapped air bubbles
- Ensure every lens surface is completely clean
- Lens elements must not be decentered or loose
- Use oil that stays clear long-term (no discoloration or precipitation)
- Re-focus after oiling to restore optimal imaging

🔹 Step 3: Loosen M12 lens lock

Most M12 lenses have a locking ring / small set screw.

Loosen just enough to rotate the lens for focus adjustment.

Keep the lens barrel supported.

🔹 Step 4: Adjust focus

Rotate the lens barrel slowly while observing the live camera feed.

Look for the sharpest image on your test target.

Zoom in on the LCD or PC and check multiple points (center + edges).

Fine-tune until center and corners are acceptably sharp.

Note: Oil can slightly change corner distortion, so prioritize center sharpness.

🔹 Step 5: Lock the lens

Tighten the M12 locking ring or set screw after final focus.

Avoid over-tightening (plastic threads may strip).

Make sure the lens does not move after locking.

### lens structure 

#### **1. Glass + plastic lenses**
- 1 glass lens in the front  
- 6 plastic lenses behind  
- Held by the long tubular structure (rear barrel)

#### **2. Rear Barrel ("the long tube inside")**
- The long cylindrical module inside the metal housing  
- Holds and aligns all lenses  
- Controls internal light path  
- Not itself a lens

#### **3. Rear Protective Window (the breakable piece)**
- Flat optical-grade glass or clear polymer  
- Always placed at the very back of the lens  
- Easy to remove or break  
- Does not change FOV or focus significantly  
- Only protects, not part of the lens formula

---

#### What Happens if You Remove the Protective Window?

##### ✔ Image still works normally  
Because it is **not part of the optical design**.

##### ✔ More dust risk  
Dust may settle on the last lens surface, causing spots.

#### ✔ Last optical element becomes exposed  
Plastic lenses scratch very easily.

##### ✔ You may need to improve sealing  
Especially if you plan to waterproof the lens.





### 🟥 (A) IR‑Cut Filter (Infrared Cut Filter)

Most M12 lenses have a small IR‑cut piece near the sensor:

- IR‑cut (infrared cut filter)
- Very thin
- Looks like glass
- Breaks if pressed
- Shows a slight blue‑green reflection
- Purpose: block infrared light to improve white balance and color accuracy

📌 Note: this is the most common “fragile small lens.”

If you break it:
- Daytime colors shift toward pink / red
- Night view becomes brighter  
  (Many night‑vision cameras intentionally omit this filter.)
