OTP (One-Time Programmable) memory is a type of non-volatile memory that can be programmed only once. It is commonly used in microcontrollers and other integrated circuits for storing firmware or configuration data that does not need to be changed after initial programming.

features of OTP memory:

- Non-volatile: Retains data even when power is removed.
- One-time programmable: Once data is written, it cannot be altered or erased.
- Cost-effective: Generally cheaper than other types of non-volatile memory like EEPROM or Flash.
- Limited capacity: Typically has a smaller storage capacity compared to other memory types.
- Fast access times: Similar to other non-volatile memory types.
