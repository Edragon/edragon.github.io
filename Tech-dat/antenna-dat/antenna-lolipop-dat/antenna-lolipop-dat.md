## What Does the "Lollipop" Antenna Do for FPV?

In FPV (First Person View) drone systems, the **Lollipop antenna** is a type of **circularly polarized antenna** designed for the video transmitter (VTX) or receiver (VRX/goggles).

### üì° Main Functions

1. **Improves Signal Stability**  
   - Circular polarization helps reduce signal dropouts and multipath interference (caused by signals bouncing off walls, trees, or the ground).  
   - This makes your FPV feed more consistent and less "glitchy".

2. **Omnidirectional Coverage**  
   - Lollipop antennas are usually **omnidirectional**, meaning they radiate and receive signals in nearly all directions around the drone.  
   - You don‚Äôt need to point the antenna perfectly toward the drone.

3. **Compact and Durable**  
   - They are small, lightweight, and often enclosed in a protective plastic shell.  
   - Good for freestyle and racing drones, since they can survive crashes better than long whip antennas.

4. **Match with Receiver Antenna**  
   - For best performance, both the VTX and goggles should use **circularly polarized antennas with the same handedness** (e.g., LHCP with LHCP, or RHCP with RHCP).

### üõ†Ô∏è When to Use
- On your **drone‚Äôs VTX** ‚Üí stable signal while flying in environments with obstacles.  
- On your **FPV goggles** ‚Üí better reception and fewer blind spots compared to linear antennas.

### ‚úÖ **Summary**:  
The FPV Lollipop antenna is a **circularly polarized omnidirectional antenna** that improves video signal quality, reduces interference, and provides reliable coverage for freestyle or racing drones.
