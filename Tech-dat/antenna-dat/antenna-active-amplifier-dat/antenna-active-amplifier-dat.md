# GPS Signal Antenna Amplifier Solutions

GPS signal antenna amplifiers (also known as active GPS antennas or GPS LNA modules) are designed to boost weak GPS signals received from satellites. These amplifiers need to have:
- Very low **noise figures** (NF)
- High **gain**
- Good **filtering characteristics** to reject out-of-band interference

## Common and Classical Solutions for GPS Signal Antenna Amplifiers

### 1. **Integrated GPS LNA + SAW Filter Modules**
These are compact modules designed specifically for GPS (L1 = 1575.42 MHz) and often include:
- **Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)** for signal boosting
- **SAW Filter** to reject nearby interference (e.g., cellular bands)

**Popular ICs / Modules:**
- **MAX2659** – Ultra-low-noise LNA for GPS, from Analog Devices (formerly Maxim) - [[MAX2659-dat]] - [[Analog-dat]]
- **BGA715L7** – GPS LNA with integrated filter from Infineon
- **ALM-1912 / ALM-1812** – Broadcom modules with built-in LNA + SAW + bias
- **SPK-GA901** – Integrated GPS LNA/filter module from Skyworks
- **u-blox ANN-MB-00 / ANN-MS-00** – Active antennas with LNA inside

**Advantages:**
- Easy integration
- Very low NF (typically 0.9 – 1.5 dB)
- Optimized for GPS L1 band

### 2. **Discrete LNA Designs (GaAs/HEMT or SiGe)**
Used in custom or high-performance systems like:
- Survey-grade GPS
- GNSS modules (multi-band)

**Common discrete LNA transistors:**
- **Avago ATF-54143** (GaAs pHEMT)
- **NEC (Renesas) NE3210S01** (GaAs HEMT)
- **Qorvo TQP3M9009** – Broadband LNA

**Typical specs:**
- Gain: 15–20 dB
- NF: 0.5–1.2 dB
- Frequency: 1.2 – 1.6 GHz (for GPS/GNSS L1/L2/L5)

**Use Case:** When you need custom filtering or bias control, or wider GNSS coverage (GPS + GLONASS + Galileo).

### 3. **GNSS Active Antenna Modules**
These are commercial antenna+amplifier combos:
- Output via coaxial cable (usually supplies bias via coax: **3.3V – 5V DC**)
- Gain: ~20–35 dB
- Built-in LNA and SAW/ceramic filters

**Examples:**
- **Taoglas active GNSS antennas** (like the AA.105)
- **Tallysman GNSS antennas** (multi-band precision)
- **u-blox ANN-MB / ANN-MS series**

### 4. **GPS LNA in RF Front-End ICs**
Used in GPS-enabled smartphones, tablets, and wearables.
- Integrated into SoCs or RFICs
- Include LNA + switches + filters

**Examples:**
- Qualcomm WTR series
- Broadcom BCM4775 (multi-band GNSS front-end)
- MediaTek MT3333/MT3339 GNSS chips

## Key Design Criteria

| Parameter          | Typical Value or Range        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Frequency**       | 1575.42 MHz (GPS L1)          |
| **Gain**            | 15–30 dB                      |
| **Noise Figure**    | < 1.5 dB (ideally < 1.0 dB)   |
| **Power Supply**    | 3.3V or 5V via coax (bias-T)  |
| **Input Impedance** | 50 ohms                       |
| **Filter Bandwidth**| ~10–20 MHz around GPS L1      |

## Want to Build One?
If you want to **design a GPS amplifier**, a typical structure is:
1. **Antenna → SAW Filter → LNA → DC Bias Tee → Receiver**
2. Optional: Use a second LNA stage for added gain (~10 dB)
3. Use a bandpass filter to suppress LTE and Wi-Fi signals
