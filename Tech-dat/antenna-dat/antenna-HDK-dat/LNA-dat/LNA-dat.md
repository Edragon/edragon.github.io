PA + LNA == Power Amplifier + Low Noise Amplifier

## What is LNA?

**LNA** stands for **Low-Noise Amplifier**.

### 📡 What It Does
An LNA is an amplifier that boosts very weak signals received by an antenna **with minimal added noise**.

### 🔍 Key Characteristics

| Feature                   | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low noise figure**      | Adds very little noise to the signal, preserving quality.   |
| **High gain**             | Amplifies weak signals for further processing.              |
| **Used in RF front-ends** | Common in radios, GPS, and satellite communication systems. |

### 🧠 Why It's Important
Weak incoming signals need to be amplified early in the signal chain. A low-noise amplifier ensures that the **signal remains clear and usable** by minimizing noise introduction.

### 📦 Common Applications
- Satellite receivers  
- GPS antennas  
- Mobile phones  
- Radio telescopes  
- SDR (Software Defined Radio)

- [[qorvo-dat]] - [[QPL9504-dat]] - Ultra Low Noise, Flat Gain LNA

- The QPL9504 is a flat gain, high-linearity, ultra-low noise amplifier in a small 2 x 2 mm surface-mount package. At 5.5 GHz, the amplifier provides 0.76 dB noise figure with 21.6 dB gain and +34 dBm OIP3 while drawing 55 mA bias current. The LNA can be biased from a single positive supply ranging from 3.3 to 5 volts. The device is housed in a green/RoHS-compliant industry-standard 2x2 mm DFN package.
