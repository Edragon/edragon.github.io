PA + LNA == Power Amplifier + Low Noise Amplifier

## What is LNA?

**LNA** stands for **Low-Noise Amplifier**.

### 📡 What It Does
An LNA is an amplifier that boosts very weak signals received by an antenna **with minimal added noise**.

### 🔍 Key Characteristics

| Feature                   | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low noise figure**      | Adds very little noise to the signal, preserving quality.   |
| **High gain**             | Amplifies weak signals for further processing.              |
| **Used in RF front-ends** | Common in radios, GPS, and satellite communication systems. |

### 🧠 Why It's Important
Weak incoming signals need to be amplified early in the signal chain. A low-noise amplifier ensures that the **signal remains clear and usable** by minimizing noise introduction.
