[[Nova-Microwave-dat]] designs and manufactures a comprehensive line of isolators for commercial applications, military applications, cellular and wireless markets. 

These devices are important to minimize the interference between incident and reflected signals. 

These devices provide a constant impedance to the transmitter, thus maximizing the power transfer by absorbing the reflected signal into the internal terminations. They are made of magnets and ferrite materials with magnetic properties.

Isolators are also available in counter-clockwise rotation.
