## components 


### Objective Lens
- The objective lens is the front lens, closest to the object being observed.
- It collects light and creates the first magnified real image.
- It determines most of the resolution, brightness, and image quality.
- In microscopes, common objective magnifications are 4×, 10×, 40×, 100×.

**Simple idea:** The objective lens is the *main lens* that actually “sees” the object.

### Eyepiece
- The eyepiece is the lens near your eye.
- It further magnifies the image produced by the objective lens.
- Changing eyepieces changes the overall magnification.

**Simple idea:** The eyepiece makes the image big enough for your eye to see.

### Total Magnification (Microscope)
Total Magnification = Objective Magnification × Eyepiece Magnification
Example: 40× objective × 10× eyepiece = 400×
