At it's core, OpenPnP is a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) controller. 

It reads a job file and then sends commands to a machine to execute. Unlike common CNC controllers for 3D printers, milling machines, and lathes, OpenPnP also uses cameras for feedback, and allows you to completely configure a job within it's user interface.

The definitions and explanations below will introduce you to the terminology used in OpenPnP, and in pick and place in general.
