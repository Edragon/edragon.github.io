The Nano 33 BLE + Nano 33 BLE Sense are now both obsolete. Their replacements are
**Nano 33 BLE Rev 2 and Nano 33 BLE Rev 2 Sense**

!!! There are issues with the code in v2.2 on these boards. It's not reliable. Please see Discord #test-firmware or GitHub actions for the most recent updates. We need more feedback on the state of this code. Thank you.
