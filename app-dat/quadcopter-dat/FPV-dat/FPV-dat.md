## parts of the FPV drones

- **Flight Controller**: The brain of the drone, responsible for stabilizing and controlling the flight. It processes data from sensors and executes commands from the pilot or autopilot system.
- **Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)**: Controls the speed of the motors by adjusting the power supplied to them. ESCs are essential for smooth and responsive flight.
- **Motors**: Provide the thrust needed for flight. Brushless motors are commonly used in FPV drones due to their efficiency and power.
- **Propellers**: Generate lift by spinning rapidly. The size and pitch of the propellers can significantly affect the drone's performance and flight characteristics.
- **Camera**: Captures real-time video for FPV flying. FPV cameras are designed to provide low-latency video transmission to the pilot's goggles or screen.

- [[VTX-dat]]: Video Transmitters are commonly referred to as VTX units. They are responsible for transmitting the video signal from the camera to the pilot's goggles or screen. VTX units come in various power levels and frequencies, allowing pilots to choose the best option for their flying environment.
- **Antenna**: Enhances the signal strength and range of the VTX. Different antenna types (e.g., dipole, patch, circular polarized) can be used to optimize performance.

- ExpressLRS: A long-range radio control link for FPV drones, known for its low latency and high refresh rates. It is an open-source project that competes with other systems like Crossfire and ELRS.
- **Goggles**: Wearable displays that allow pilots to see the live video feed from the drone's camera. They often include features like head tracking and DVR (Digital Video Recorder) capabilities.

## standards 

### PNP stands for "Plug and Play." 

In the context of FPV drones, a PNP version means that the drone comes mostly assembled but does not include a radio receiver.

Here's why it doesn't include a receiver:

Flexibility: PNP versions cater to experienced FPV pilots who already have their preferred radio transmitter and receiver. This allows them to use their existing equipment and avoid paying for redundant components.
Customization: Pilots might have specific receiver requirements based on their radio system (e.g., TBS Crossfire, ELRS, FrSky). Offering a PNP version lets them choose the exact receiver that's compatible with their setup.
Cost Savings: By excluding the receiver, the manufacturer can offer the PNP version at a lower price point, making it attractive to those who don't need the included receiver.
In short, PNP versions are designed for users who want to use their own radio gear and prefer to avoid unnecessary costs or compatibility issues.
