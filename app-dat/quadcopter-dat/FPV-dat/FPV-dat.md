## standards 

### PNP stands for "Plug and Play." 

In the context of FPV drones, a PNP version means that the drone comes mostly assembled but does not include a radio receiver.

Here's why it doesn't include a receiver:

Flexibility: PNP versions cater to experienced FPV pilots who already have their preferred radio transmitter and receiver. This allows them to use their existing equipment and avoid paying for redundant components.
Customization: Pilots might have specific receiver requirements based on their radio system (e.g., TBS Crossfire, ELRS, FrSky). Offering a PNP version lets them choose the exact receiver that's compatible with their setup.
Cost Savings: By excluding the receiver, the manufacturer can offer the PNP version at a lower price point, making it attractive to those who don't need the included receiver.
In short, PNP versions are designed for users who want to use their own radio gear and prefer to avoid unnecessary costs or compatibility issues.
