## single-phase counter energy meter


A single-phase counter energy meter is typically used to measure and record electricity consumption in single-phase power systems. These meters are suitable for homes, small businesses, and similar scenarios. Below are its main features and working principles:

### Features:

Single-phase design: Suitable for single-phase power systems (usually 220V).
Counter display: Displays electricity consumption using a mechanical counter or an LCD screen (usually in kilowatt-hours, kWh).
Measurement accuracy: Generally complies with national standards and provides accurate measurement of electricity consumption.
Easy installation: Compact size, easy to install and maintain.
Cost-effective: Relatively affordable, making it a common choice for households and small users.



### Working Principle:

A single-phase counter energy meter calculates the actual electricity consumption by measuring the product of voltage and current, combined with the meter's internal time reference. Its basic components include:

- Voltage and current sensors: Detect the voltage and current in the circuit.
- Energy calculation module: Calculates power and accumulates it into electricity consumption.
- Display module: Displays the cumulative electricity consumption.



### Application Scenarios:

- Residential homes: Monitors daily electricity consumption in households.
- Small shops: Records daily electricity usage for small businesses.
- Rental properties: Tracks electricity consumption for billing purposes.

For a more advanced option, you can consider smart energy meters with remote communication features, which support remote meter reading and real-time electricity usage analysis.
