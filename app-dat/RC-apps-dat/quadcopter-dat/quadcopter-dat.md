## Multirotor Drones (or Multirotor UAVs).

Multirotor refers to any drone with multiple rotors (propellers) for lift and control.

Subcategories include:

Tricopter – 3 rotors

Quadcopter – 4 rotors

Hexacopter – 6 rotors

Octocopter – 8 rotors




## Quadcopter vs Octocopter

| Feature                         | Quadcopter                                                                                             | Octocopter                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power & Payload**             | Sufficient power for small drones; simple structure and lightweight; relatively low energy consumption | Higher thrust, can carry heavy cameras or sensors; multi-motor redundancy allows flight even if one or two motors fail |
| **Drawbacks**                   | Limited payload; less stable in high wind                                                              | High energy consumption; complex structure, heavier; higher requirements for takeoff and operation                     |
| **Stability & Wind Resistance** | Easy to control in low wind; agile and responsive                                                      | Strong wind resistance; multi-motor redundancy increases flight safety                                                 |
| **Drawbacks**                   | Weak wind resistance; prone to crash if one motor fails                                                | Slightly slower response; less agile than quadcopter                                                                   |
| **Cost & Maintenance**          | Low cost; fewer motors and controllers, easier maintenance                                             | High cost; complex maintenance, more motors prone to failure; higher battery requirements                              |
| **Typical Applications**        | Recreational aerial photography, educational experiments, light surveillance                           | Professional aerial photography, industrial inspection, payload transport, rescue missions                             |
| **Summary**                     | Lightweight, flexible, low cost; suitable for recreational and light-duty tasks                        | Powerful, wind-resistant, heavy-lift capable; suitable for professional and industrial use                             |
