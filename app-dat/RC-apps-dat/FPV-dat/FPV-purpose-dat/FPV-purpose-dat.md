## Better Cinewhoop Options Than Mobula8

If your goal is **cinematic FPV footage**, there are stronger options than the Mobula8.  
Key things to look for in a cinewhoop:
- Larger frame with ducts/guards â†’ protects props, cleaner footage.
- Stronger motors/ESCs â†’ can carry payload (Insta360 GO, Naked GoPro, etc.).
- HD video system (DJI O3, Walksnail, HDZero, or high-quality analog).
- Stable flight time even with payload.
