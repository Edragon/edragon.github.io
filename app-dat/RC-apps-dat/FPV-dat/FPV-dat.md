## parts of the FPV drones


- [[flight-controller-dat]]

- [[ESC-dat]]

- **Motors**: Provide the thrust needed for flight. Brushless motors are commonly used in FPV drones due to their efficiency and power.

- **Propellers**: Generate lift by spinning rapidly. The size and pitch of the propellers can significantly affect the drone's performance and flight characteristics.

- [[SCU1059-dat]] - [[propeller-dat]]

- **Camera**: Captures real-time video for FPV flying. FPV cameras are designed to provide low-latency video transmission to the pilot's goggles or screen.

- [[VTX-dat]]: Video Transmitters are commonly referred to as VTX units. They are responsible for transmitting the video signal from the camera to the pilot's goggles or screen. VTX units come in various power levels and frequencies, allowing pilots to choose the best option for their flying environment.
- **Antenna**: Enhances the signal strength and range of the VTX. Different antenna types (e.g., dipole, patch, circular polarized) can be used to optimize performance.

- **ExpressLRS**: A long-range radio control link for FPV drones, known for its low latency and high refresh rates. It is an open-source project that competes with other systems like Crossfire and ELRS.

  - [[ELRS-dat]]

- **Goggles**: Wearable displays that allow pilots to see the live video feed from the drone's camera. They often include features like head tracking and DVR (Digital Video Recorder) capabilities.

## standards 

### PNP stands for "Plug and Play." 

In the context of FPV drones, a PNP version means that the drone comes mostly assembled but does not include a radio receiver.

Here's why it doesn't include a receiver:

Flexibility: PNP versions cater to experienced FPV pilots who already have their preferred radio transmitter and receiver. This allows them to use their existing equipment and avoid paying for redundant components.
Customization: Pilots might have specific receiver requirements based on their radio system (e.g., TBS Crossfire, ELRS, FrSky). Offering a PNP version lets them choose the exact receiver that's compatible with their setup.
Cost Savings: By excluding the receiver, the manufacturer can offer the PNP version at a lower price point, making it attractive to those who don't need the included receiver.
In short, PNP versions are designed for users who want to use their own radio gear and prefer to avoid unnecessary costs or compatibility issues.

## BEE25 

Propeller Size: 2.5 inches

The SpeedyBee Bee25 is a compact 2.5-inch cinewhoop drone designed for agility and portability, especially suited for indoor and tight-space flying.


## wheelbase 

In FPV drones, the **wheelbase** refers to the **diagonal distance between the centers of the two furthest-apart motors**, usually measured in **millimeters (mm)**. It’s a standard way to classify the size of a drone frame.

---

### 🧩 Why Wheelbase Matters

- **Determines Propeller Size**: Larger wheelbase = larger props supported.
- **Affects Maneuverability**: Smaller wheelbase = more agile, Larger = more stable.
- **Influences Payload**: Bigger wheelbase frames can carry heavier gear (e.g., action cameras, larger batteries).

---

### 📏 Common FPV Drone Wheelbase Categories

## FPV tech 

### Multi-Sensor Fusion
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: Detects acceleration and angular velocity changes.  
- **GPS / GLONASS / Galileo**: Provides precise global positioning for drift correction.  
- **Barometer**: Measures altitude changes due to vertical wind.  
- **Vision Positioning System (VPS)**: Assists in holding position when GPS is weak or unavailable.  

All sensor data are fused together for real-time position and attitude correction.


Drones estimate wind speed using GPS drift and IMU feedback.

If it exceeds safe thresholds (e.g., >12 m/s), the system:

- Limits tilt angles.
- Warns the pilot.
- Plans **energy-efficient return routes** considering wind direction.



### 🧰 How to Improve Betaflight Wind Handling

If you want DJI-like stability in a Betaflight-based drone, you can try:

- **Use “Angle” or “Horizon” mode** — these self-level automatically.
- **Tune PID properly** — higher D-term helps fight oscillations caused by gusts.
- **Use a heavier frame** — more mass = less effect from wind.
- **Add GPS + switch to iNav or Ardupilot** — they support position hold and altitude hold.
- **Use high-quality ESCs and motors** for faster response.



### DJI VS betaflight 


# DJI vs Betaflight Comparison Table

| Feature / Capability | **DJI Drones** | **Betaflight (Typical FPV Quad)** | Explanation |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **Main Purpose** | Aerial photography, autonomous flight | FPV racing, freestyle acrobatics | DJI focuses on automation and stability, Betaflight on agility and control. |
| **Flight Control Algorithm** | PID + MPC (Model Predictive Control) + Sensor Fusion | PID only | DJI uses predictive and adaptive control; Betaflight uses classic PID. |
| **Sensor Fusion** | Yes (IMU + GPS + Barometer + Vision Sensors) | Limited (IMU only) | DJI fuses multiple sensors for precision control; Betaflight relies mainly on IMU. |
| **GPS Position Hold** | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Requires external GPS + iNav/Ardupilot | Betaflight doesn’t handle position hold natively. |
| **Vision Positioning (VPS)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | DJI uses downward cameras for indoor stability. |
| **Altitude Hold** | ✅ Precise (barometer + GPS + VPS) | ⚠️ Basic (Angle mode only) | DJI maintains accurate height even in wind; Betaflight does not. |
| **Wind Resistance / Compensation** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual (pilot controlled) | DJI detects and corrects wind drift automatically. |
| **Return to Home (RTH)** | ✅ Smart, automatic | ⚠️ Only with GPS add-ons | DJI calculates safe routes; Betaflight doesn’t. |
| **Wind Estimation & Feedforward Control** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | DJI predicts wind disturbance and adjusts preemptively. |
| **IMU Attitude Stabilization** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Both can stabilize attitude, but DJI integrates more sensors. |
| **Motor Control Response** | High-speed ESCs with adaptive algorithms | High-speed ESCs (pilot-driven) | DJI adjusts motor speeds automatically; Betaflight follows pilot commands. |
| **User Control Focus** | Semi/fully autonomous | Fully manual | DJI reduces workload; Betaflight gives full manual control. |
| **System Complexity** | High (proprietary flight controller, AI algorithms) | Moderate (open-source firmware) | DJI uses closed systems with advanced computation. |
| **Tuning Requirement** | Minimal (auto-calibration) | Manual PID tuning needed | DJI tunes itself; Betaflight requires user tuning. |
| **Firmware Platform** | Proprietary DJI Flight Controller | Open-source Betaflight | DJI closed system vs Betaflight open community. |
| **Use Case Summary** | Stable, cinematic, automated | Fast, agile, pilot-skill-based | Different design goals and priorities. |

### 🧭 Summary

- **DJI** = Stability, automation, wind resistance, and ease of use.  
- **Betaflight** = Agility, manual control, and racing performance.  

If you want DJI-like wind compensation on a custom drone, use **iNav** or **Ardupilot** instead of Betaflight — they support GPS position hold, altitude hold, and auto-leveling with similar logic to DJI.
