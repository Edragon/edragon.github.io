**VTOL** stands for **Vertical Take-Off and Landing**.  
A **VTOL drone** is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can **take off and land vertically** like a helicopter, but also **fly horizontally** like a fixed-wing airplane.

## 1. Key Features of VTOL Drones

- **Vertical take-off and landing** – no runway needed  
- **Transition to forward flight** – flies like a plane for higher speed and longer range  
- **Hybrid propulsion** – usually combines rotors for vertical lift and wings for horizontal flight

## 2. Types of VTOL Drones

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Tilt-rotor** | Rotors tilt from vertical (for lift) to horizontal (for forward flight) |
| **Tilt-wing** | Entire wing tilts, changing rotor direction for forward flight |
| **Lift+Cruise** | Separate rotors for vertical lift and a fixed propeller or motor for forward flight |
| **Multirotor with transition** | Standard multirotor drones modified with wings for longer endurance |

## 3. Advantages

- Can take off and land in **small or confined areas**  
- Combines **hovering capability** with **efficient forward flight**  
- Ideal for **surveying, mapping, delivery, and inspection**

## 4. Examples

- **Military / commercial VTOL UAVs**: V-22 Osprey (manned, tilt-rotor)  
- **Commercial drones**: Wingcopter, DJI VTOL prototypes  
- **RC / hobby VTOL drones**: Electric models with tilt-rotors or lift+cruise designs
