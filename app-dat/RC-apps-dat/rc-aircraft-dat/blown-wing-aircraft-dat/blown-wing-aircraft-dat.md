## info 

A **blown-wing aircraft** is an aircraft that uses **forced airflow** blown over the wing or flaps to significantly increase lift.  
This technique improves **low-speed performance** and allows **short takeoff and landing (STOL)** operations.

---

## 1. Basic Concept

Normally, wings generate lift from the natural airflow as the aircraft moves forward.

A blown-wing system adds **extra high-speed airflow** over the wing surface, usually from:

- Propellers  
- Jet exhaust  
- Ducted fans  
- Engine-driven compressors  

This extra airflow:

- Keeps airflow attached to the wing  
- Delays stall  
- Greatly increases lift at low airspeeds  

This is a form of **powered lift** or **boundary layer control**.

## 2. Types of Blown-Wing Systems

| Type | English Term | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Propeller-blown wing | **propeller blown wing** | Propeller wash blows directly over the wing |
| Jet-blown flaps | **jet-blown flaps** | Jet exhaust directed onto flaps |
| Ducted blown wing | **ducted blown wing** | Fan airflow routed through ducts to the wing |
| Coandă-effect system | **Coandă-effect blown wing** | Airflow sticks to curved surfaces to enhance lift |

## 3. Famous Examples

- **NASA QSRA** (Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft)  
- **Antonov An-72 / An-74** (jet-blown high-lift system)  
- **Boeing YC-14** (Coandă-effect blown flaps)  
- Many **STOL RC models** use prop-wash blown wings to improve lift

---

## 4. Advantages

- Very short takeoff and landing distances  
- Excellent low-speed control  
- Higher lift at high angles of attack  
- Useful for STOL research, military, and experimental aircraft  

---

## 5. Applications

- Short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft  
- Urban air mobility research  
- High-lift experimental aircraft  
- RC aircraft requiring improved low-speed lift
