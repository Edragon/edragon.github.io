Yes — the BetaFPV Meteor65 Pro supports Betaflight.

It comes with BetaFPV’s F4 1S AIO flight controller, which is fully compatible with Betaflight.

Out of the box, it is usually pre-flashed with Betaflight firmware.

You can connect it to Betaflight Configurator via USB-C to adjust PIDs, rates, filters, receiver setup, OSD, etc.

Many people use Betaflight for Meteor65 Pro, but it also supports Bluejay ESC firmware (for 48/96 kHz PWM and bidirectional DShot).

✅ So yes — you can set it up, tune, and fly it in Betaflight without issues.
