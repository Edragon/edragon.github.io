## 🏍️ Comparison: Mid-Drive Motor vs Off-Road Electric Dirt Bike Motor

### 1. ⚙️ Torque & Power

| Type                        | Example Model               | Power         | Max Torque      |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mid-Drive E-Bike Motor      | Bosch CX / Shimano EP8      | 250–1000W     | 60–160 Nm       |
| Electric Dirt Bike Motor    | Sur-Ron Light Bee X         | 5000W peak    | ~250 Nm         |
|                             | Talaria Sting R             | 6000W peak    | ~280–300 Nm     |
|                             | Cake Kalk OR                | 11,000W       | ~280 Nm         |

🟢 **Mid-drive motors** use **bike gears** to multiply torque, but they still **can't match raw torque** of dirt bike motors.  
🔴 **Electric dirt bikes** use **direct-drive or geared motors** with massive torque, designed for off-road power.

### 2. 🪶 Weight & Size

| Type                        | Motor Weight     | Total Bike Weight      |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Mid-Drive E-Bike Motor      | ~3–5 kg          | 18–25 kg (bike)         |
| Electric Dirt Bike Motor    | ~10–15 kg        | 50–70+ kg (bike)        |

Mid-drive systems are compact and light for pedaling.  
Electric dirt bikes are heavy-duty and built for **power**, not pedaling.

### 3. ⚡ Power Source & Battery

| Type                        | Voltage     | Battery Size             |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Mid-Drive E-Bike            | 36V / 48V   | 300–700 Wh                |
| Electric Dirt Bike          | 60V / 72V   | 1000–3000 Wh+ (1–3 kWh)   |

Electric dirt bikes use **high-voltage, high-capacity batteries** to feed the powerful motors.
