An "EDC light" refers to an **Everyday Carry flashlight**.

It's a small, portable flashlight designed to be carried on one's person daily, typically in a pocket, on a keychain, or in a bag.

Key characteristics of EDC lights usually include:

*   **Compact Size and Lightweight:** Easy to carry without being burdensome.
*   **Durability:** Often made from materials like aluminum, titanium, or stainless steel to withstand daily wear and tear.
*   **Sufficient Brightness:** Provides enough light for common daily tasks (e.g., finding items in a bag, navigating in the dark, emergency situations) but not necessarily extreme brightness like larger tactical flashlights.
*   **Good Battery Life:** Or at least reasonable runtime for their size, often using common battery types (AAA, AA, CR123A) or rechargeable cells (like 10440, 14500, 18650 in smaller lights).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple operation, often with multiple brightness modes.
*   **Reliability:** Designed to work when needed.
*   **Carry Options:** May include pocket clips, lanyard holes, or keychain attachments.

EDC lights are popular among people who value preparedness, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone who might need a reliable light source unexpectedly.
