PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.


**PLC** stands for **Programmable Logic Controller**.

## Definition
A **PLC** is an **industrial digital computer** designed to control manufacturing processes or machinery. It is widely used in **automation** to monitor inputs, make logic-based decisions, and control outputs.

## Key Characteristics
- **Programmable**: Custom logic can be created using ladder logic, function blocks, or structured text.
- **Reliable and Rugged**: Designed for harsh industrial environments (dust, heat, vibration).
- **Real-Time Control**: Monitors sensors (inputs) and controls actuators (outputs) in real time.

## Typical Applications
- Assembly lines
- Packaging machines
- Robotics
- Elevator control systems
- Water treatment plants

## Example
A PLC might:
1. Receive a signal from a **temperature sensor**.
2. Compare it to a threshold.
3. If itâ€™s too high, activate a **cooling fan** using a relay output.
