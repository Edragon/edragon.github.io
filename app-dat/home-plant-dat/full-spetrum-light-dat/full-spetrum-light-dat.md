# Why Do Plants Need Full-Spectrum Light?

Plants need **full-spectrum light** for growth because it closely mimics natural sunlight, providing the essential wavelengths required for **photosynthesis and healthy development**. Here’s why full-spectrum light is important for plants:

## 1. Covers All Necessary Wavelengths  
- **Blue Light (400–500 nm)** → Stimulates vegetative growth, strong leaves, and root development.  
- **Red Light (600–700 nm)** → Promotes flowering and fruiting.  
- **Green Light (500–600 nm)** → Helps penetrate deeper into leaves for balanced growth.  
- **UV Light (Below 400 nm)** → Enhances plant defense mechanisms and improves color and flavor in some plants.  
- **Infrared (Above 700 nm)** → Encourages stretching and flowering.

## 2. Mimics Natural Sunlight  
- Since the sun provides a full spectrum of light, plants evolved to use all its wavelengths.  
- Standard bulbs (like warm white LEDs or fluorescents) lack certain wavelengths, leading to weak or unbalanced growth.

## 3. Supports Different Growth Stages  
- **Seedlings & Vegetative Stage** → Needs more **blue light** for strong leaves and stems.  
- **Flowering & Fruiting Stage** → Requires more **red and infrared light** to stimulate blooms and fruit development.  

## 4. Improves Plant Health & Yield  
- A proper full-spectrum light helps plants grow **faster, healthier, and with better yields** compared to limited-spectrum lighting.  
- Some plants, like leafy greens, grow well under **blue-dominant light**, while fruiting plants (like tomatoes) need **more red light**.
