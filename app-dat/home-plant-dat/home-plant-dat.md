## type 

### Mushroom 

- Mushrooms generally thrive in high humidity, often between 80% and 95%, depending on the species. 

- The temperature range for growing mushrooms is typically between 15°C to 24°C

## system 

### Temperature and Humidity 

Humidity Tray: Place a shallow tray of water with some pebbles or stones in the growing area. 

The water will slowly evaporate, increasing the humidity. You can add a small fan to circulate the air around the tray, which helps maintain airflow while boosting humidity.

### Air Flow

The term "fresh air" for plants, in a technical sense, generally refers to an optimal supply of oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), along with proper air circulation, which are essential for the healthy growth and metabolism of plants.
