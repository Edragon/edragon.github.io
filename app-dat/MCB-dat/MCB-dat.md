From the picture, you can see:

1. The device model is identified as "CNXANMR DZ47-63 C63"
2. Specifications are marked "230/400V~" (indicating rated voltage)
3. "IEC60898" (International Electrotechnical Standard)
4. "GB10963" (Chinese National Standard)
5. "100A-4500A" (may indicate rated current range or breaking capacity)
6. There is an ON/OFF switch, currently in the ON position

This is a device used for circuit protection. It automatically cuts off the circuit when an overload or short circuit occurs, protecting electrical equipment and personal safety. DZ47-63 is a common model of miniature circuit breaker, and C63 indicates its rated current is 63 amperes.

This type of circuit breaker is very common in low-voltage power distribution systems in China and many other countries.
This is a miniature circuit breaker (MCB), model DZ47-63 C63. It is used for circuit protection and automatically disconnects when the current exceeds safe limits, preventing electrical fires and equipment damage.

Main parameters:

- Brand: CNXANMR
- Model: DZ47-63 C63
- Rated voltage: 230/400V~
- Complies with standards: IEC60898 and GB10963 (Chinese National Standard)
