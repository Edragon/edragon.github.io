## Mach3: CNC Control Software (Short Summary)

**Mach3** is PC-based software that transforms a computer into a CNC machine controller. It's popular among hobbyists and small businesses for various machines like mills, routers, lathes, and plasma cutters.

**How it Works (Simplified):**
1.  **Input:** Loads G-code (CNC program instructions).
2.  **Processing:** Interprets G-code and plans machine movements.
3.  **Output:** Sends electrical pulse signals to control the machine's motors and components.
    *   **Interface:** Historically used the PC's parallel port. Modern setups typically use more reliable **external motion controllers** (USB/Ethernet) that receive commands from Mach3 and generate precise motor signals.
4.  **Control:** Manages axes movement, spindle speed, and other machine functions based on the G-code.

It provides a user interface for loading files, manual control, and machine configuration. While older, it's known for its rich features and customizability.
