## AGV

An AGV is an Automated Guided Vehicle.

It is a portable robot that follows along marked long lines or wires on the floor, or uses radio waves, vision cameras, magnets, or lasers for navigation. AGVs are most often used in industrial applications to transport heavy materials around a large industrial building, such as a factory or warehouse.

## ROS 

The document mentions "ROS" but doesn't define what a "ROS vehicle" is.

However, **ROS (Robot Operating System)** is a flexible framework for writing robot software. A "ROS vehicle" would therefore be any vehicle (like an AGV, a drone, a robotic car, etc.) that uses ROS for its control, navigation, perception, or other autonomous functionalities.

ROS provides:

- Hardware abstraction
- Low-level device control
- Implementation of commonly used functionality (e.g., navigation, mapping, localization)
- Message-passing between processes
- Package management
- Tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.

So, a ROS vehicle is essentially a vehicle whose "brain" or software is built using the Robot Operating System.
