### Talon 1400 Overview

#### What is the Talon 1400?
The **Talon 1400** is a high-performance, **3D-printed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)** developed by Flightory. It is optimized for long-range and efficient flight.

##### Specifications:
- **Wingspan:** 1,305 mm  
- **Length:** 830 mm  
- **Flight Time:** Up to 4 hours (with large Li-Ion 4S6P battery)  
- **Materials:** LW-PLA and PETG  
- **Airfoil:** Eppler E205  
- **Optimal Cruise Speed:** 55-65 km/h  

#### Is It Betaflight-Based?

**No**, the Talon 1400 is **not** based on Betaflight. Since it is a **fixed-wing UAV**, it is more suited for **autonomous flight controllers** rather than Betaflight, which is designed for FPV racing drones.

##### Recommended Flight Controllers:

- **Mateksys F405-Wing / F765-Wing**  
- **Pixhawk (PX4 or ArduPilot firmware)**  
- **Holybro Kakute F7 / H743-Wing**  

These controllers support **GPS navigation, waypoint missions, and return-to-home (RTH)**, making them better suited for long-range operations.
