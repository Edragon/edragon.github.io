CRSF (Crossfire Serial Protocol) is a low-latency, high-speed serial protocol developed by **Team BlackSheep (TBS)** for communication between radio receivers (like TBS Crossfire Nano RX) and flight controllers.

Itâ€™s used in RC applications (especially FPV drones) to transmit RC channel data, telemetry, and link status over a compact serial format.

CRSF packets are binary data. Here's the basic structure of a CRSF packet:

## CRSF Packet Structure (General)

| Byte Index | Name           | Description                                 |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0          | Device Address | Who is sending (e.g., RX, TX)               |
| 1          | Frame Length   | Length of payload + 1 (type byte + data)    |
| 2          | Frame Type     | Type of data (e.g., RC channels, telemetry) |
| 3 - N      | Payload        | Actual data, varies by Frame Type           |
| Last Byte  | CRC            | Checksum for packet validation              |


This is how a typical RC channel data packet might look (in hex):

C8 18 16 A1 84 3F C1 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9E

## RC Channel Encoding (Packed 11-bit)

Each RC channel is packed as 11-bit little-endian integers, with up to 16 channels per frame. Example values:

- 1000 â†’ channel center
- 172 â†’ min
- 1811 â†’ max

## read data via serial 

Yes, you can use a serial port to read CRSF data, because CRSF is a serial protocol â€” specifically, a half-duplex, asynchronous UART protocol using 8N1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).

### ðŸ“¡ CRSF over Serial â€“ Quick Guide

- **Baud rate**: 420000 or 115200 (depends on TX/RX version or setting)
- **Protocol**: UART (8N1)
- **Signal direction**: Half-duplex (same wire for TX and RX)
- **Voltage**: 3.3V (NOT 5V safe on most Crossfire receivers)
- **Typical usage**: Read CRSF data from TBS Nano RX or TX

#### ðŸ§° What You Need:
- A microcontroller or board with UART support (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, STM32, Raspberry Pi)
- Logic-level conversion (if needed for 3.3V safety)
- CRSF-compatible device (e.g., TBS Crossfire Nano RX)

Code Concept (Pseudocode)


    Serial.begin(420000); // Or 115200 for some TX modules

    void loop() {
    if (Serial.available()) {
        uint8_t byte = Serial.read();
        // Process CRSF packet bytes here
    }
    }

If you wish to use telemetry then a receiver can be connected to a UART utilizing the CRSF protocol.

CRSF is a full-duplex protocol that supports integrated telemetry and a number of other features. Connect the RX pin of the UART to the CRSF TX pin of the CRSF device and vice versa. Currently a full-duplex UART connection is required. For best performance a UART with DMA capability on its RX port is desirable, but not required. A message will be displayed once on the GCS console, if connected to a UART without this capability on an F4/F7 based autopilot.
