**Receiver Bind Mode (ExpressLRS)**

- Many ELRS receivers (including Mobula8’s built-in) enter **Wi-Fi update mode** or **bind mode** if you power cycle 3 times quickly.  
- Example:
    - Plug in → unplug → plug in → unplug → plug in (within ~30 seconds).
- After the 3rd time, the receiver LED changes behavior (solid/fast blink), allowing binding with your Radiomaster Pocket.
