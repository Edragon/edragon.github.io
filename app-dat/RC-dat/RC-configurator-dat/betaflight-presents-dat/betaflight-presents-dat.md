- 96k+ ESC PWM Settings

Given what I know about Mobula8 (a small whoop / micro style quad), here’s what I think:

If your ESC & frame / airflow are decent and you mostly fly indoors or want quieter motors: go with 48 kHz. It’s a safe, good all-round choice.

If you want the quietest possible operation and are willing to manage heat, 96 kHz+ may be okay if your ESC supports it and you monitor temps.

If you fly outdoors a lot, or you want max efficiency (battery life, less heat), and don’t mind a little noise / less silky low-throttle, 16-24 kHz might be more reliable.
