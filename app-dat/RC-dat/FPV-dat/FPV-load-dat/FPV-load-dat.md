## Can the BetaFPV Pavo25 (Bee25) Carry a 120g GoPro?

Yes, the **BetaFPV Pavo25** can carry a **120g GoPro** (like the HERO11 Mini), but **with limitations**.

---

### 🔋 Battery & Flight Time

- **Recommended battery**: 4S 650–850mAh LiPo
- **With a naked GoPro (~30g)**: ~4–5 minutes of flight
- **With a full GoPro (~120g)**: ~2–3 minutes of flight
- **Heavier load** = more power draw = **shorter flight time** and **higher heat**

---

### ⚙️ Hardware Requirements

- **Motors**: Stock 1404 4500KV can lift it, but performance drops
- **Battery**: Use a **high C-rate** (≥75C) to avoid voltage sag
- **Frame**: Strip off any unnecessary accessories to reduce weight

---

### 🛑 Potential Drawbacks

- **Increased ESC and motor temperature**
- **Reduced agility and climb rate**
- **Poor handling in wind**
- **Shorter battery life**
- **Risk of motor burnout** if pushed too hard

---

### ✅ Tips for Better Performance

- Use a **"naked GoPro"** (~30–35g) to lighten the load
- Fly in **calm weather**
- Limit aggressive maneuvers
- Consider switching to a **larger cinewhoop** (like Pavo30, Defender 25, or CineLog30)
