## ‚úÖ When Tank Tracks Are Better
- **Soft Terrain** (sand, mud, snow):
  - Tracks distribute weight over a larger surface, preventing sinking.
- **Uneven Terrain** (rocks, slopes, obstacles):
  - Tracks provide better grip and stability.
- **Heavy Loads**:
  - Tracks can support and move heavier equipment with more traction.

## ‚úÖ When Wheels Are Better
- **Hard, Flat Terrain** (pavement, concrete):
  - Wheels are faster and more energy-efficient.
- **Speed & Efficiency**:
  - Wheeled systems are usually lighter and less power-hungry.
- **Maintenance & Cost**:
  - Wheels are simpler, cheaper, and easier to repair.
