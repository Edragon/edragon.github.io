what is the VTX in FPV?
- VTX = video transmitter, the device that transmits the video signal from the drone to the goggles or monitor.
- AIO = all in one, a flight controller that integrates multiple components into a single unit, including the flight controller, ESC (electronic speed controller), and sometimes the VTX.
- smart audio = a feature that allows you to control the VTX settings (such as frequency and power) from the flight controller or goggles, without needing to access the VTX directly.
- IRC Tramp = a type of smart audio protocol used by some VTXs, allowing for remote control of the VTX settings.

- TBS UNIFY PRO 32 HV V2 = a high-voltage version of the TBS UNIFY PRO 32 VTX, which supports higher power output and is designed for use with high-voltage battery systems.
