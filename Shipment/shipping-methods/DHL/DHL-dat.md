Dear customer,

We are processing your shipment with DHL, the problem is the zip code can not match the city name in DHL shipping system. It has to be matched for their system.

We have manually fixed this into:

zipcode: 4026 - cityname: SANTA ROSA CITY

You can find the match here: https://dct.dhl.com/

Please let me know back if this is incorrect to use. Please also note to update the address if you need to order next time. 

This will make a little one day maxiumium delay to shipment.

Thank you. Best regards,
