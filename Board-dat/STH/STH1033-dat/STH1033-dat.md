## AM1011A — Upgraded Humidity & Temperature Sensor (English)

AM1011A is an upgraded sensor featuring a dedicated ASIC, a high-performance silicon-based capacitive humidity sensor, and an on-chip temperature sensor. It provides an analog voltage output (0–3 V). Improvements over the previous generation include better stability in high-temperature/high-humidity environments, improved accuracy, faster response time, and a wider measurement range. Each unit is factory-calibrated and tested for reliable mass deployment.
