5 of the ESP Control boards are not working as expected. When the outputs for the WRGB channels should be off they are still providing anywhere from 17 to 24 volts when using a 24 v power supply. 

The 5 that work all read 0 V when the channels are disabled. 

I have tried changing some software components but have not solved it. 

Is it possible that some of the mosfets are bad? What can I do to test that there is a hardware issue? If it is a hardware issue would it be possible to get a partial refund?
