Note 

1. Unless otherwise specified, all specifications are measured at an input of 230vaC, rated load, and an ambient temperature of 25°C;
2. Ripple and noise measurement method: use a 12" twisted pair cable, and connect a 0.1uF capacitor in parallel to the terminal, and measure at a bandwidth of 20MHz;
3. Accuracy: includes the shear error, linear regulation rate, and load regulation rate;
4. The power supply should be regarded as part of the components in the system, and electromagnetic compatibility related confirmation should be carried out in conjunction with the terminal equipment;
5. The output needs to be reduced under low input voltage. Please refer to the reduction curve for details;
