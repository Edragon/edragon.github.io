**Product Features:**

1. **Toggle Switch and Dual-Color Indicator Light**: Allows direct switching between 1A and 2A discharge currents. When switched to 1A, the green light is on. When switched to 2A, the red light is on.

2. **Large Copper Area and Additional Heat Dissipation Holes**: The backside has an expanded copper area with added heat dissipation holes to enhance cooling performance.

3. **Genuine 5-Ohm Wire-Wound Resistor**: The discharge resistor is a custom-made, genuine 5-ohm wire-wound resistor (with higher cost) for more accurate testing results, closer to 1A and 2A.

**Module Usage Instructions:**

- **Function Switching**: When your power output reaches 1A, switch to the 1A mode for testing. When your power output is 2A or higher, switch to the 2A mode for testing.

**Judgment Criteria:**

- Insert the USB power supply or mobile power bank into the USB output port. When in 1A mode, the green light will be on. When switched to 2A mode, the red light will be on.

**Precautions:**

1. When the load tester is working, the wire-wound resistor will generate extremely high temperatures due to the large current passing through. Therefore, during and shortly after use, **do not touch the wire-wound resistor with bare skin** to avoid burns! Also, keep flammable objects away from the tester to prevent fires! Always exercise caution when using this device.

2. Due to the unique nature of the wire-wound resistor, during the first use after powering on, you may notice a small amount of white smoke and an unusual odor. This occurs because the outer coating contains a very small amount of moisture, which evaporates when heated at high temperatures. The smell is caused by the outer coating being baked by the heat. This phenomenon will disappear after some usage and is completely normal. Thereâ€™s no need to worry about damage to the load tester, and you can continue to use it with confidence.
