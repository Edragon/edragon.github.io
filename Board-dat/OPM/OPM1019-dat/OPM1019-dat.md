## Problem solving 

When the car starts, the voltage will be pulled down to 7V or less, and the voltage will be as high as 15V or higher when the engine is running at high speed. It is difficult for electrical appliances working at 12V to work properly. This automatic step-up and step-down module solves this problem. Regardless of the input voltage of 5V, 12V or 32V, the output can be stabilized at 12V.


## Application areas:

Automotive voltage stabilization, solar photovoltaic power generation, wind power generation and other applications with unstable voltage.
