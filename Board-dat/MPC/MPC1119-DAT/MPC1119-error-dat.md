Please refer to the image above. There is an overlapping wire on the PCB, highlighted in the **YELLOW** box.

To quickly fix this issue, please cut the **BLUE** wire on the back of the PCB and reconnect the pins indicated by the two **ORANGE** boxes.

**If you require a replacement, please just reply to the order email, and we will send you a new board.**

We sincerely apologize for this issue. This will be corrected in the next production batch, which will be released as a new version.
