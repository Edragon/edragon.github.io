Applications: This driver board can drive micro 3-wire or 4-wire Hall-free brushless motors such as hard disk brushless motors and optical drive brushless motors.


This driver board can drive micro 3-wire or 4-wire Hall-less brushless motors such as hard disk brushless motors and optical drive brushless motors. 

The driver board has reverse voltage protection, overcurrent protection, short circuit protection, simple wiring, and worry-free use. 

The hard disk motor can rotate with a voltage of 7-12V. The higher the voltage, the faster the speed, and the peak value can reach about 10,000 revolutions.
