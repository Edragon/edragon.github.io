## Is this module able to detect multiple RFID cards same time?


It does not support simultaneous detections. 


## can the antenna be smaller? 

- NO, unless to cut the sensing distance 

## can it detect the card staying in the sensing area? 

- No 

## Can be integrated into plastic case? 

Yes, below is an animal checker device.

## other RFID cards or keys 

- no guarantee the same performance, high quality RFID cards or tags are required!

## performance

- Any microcontrollers should work, and lithium batteries also work, just add more capacitors to filterÂ the noise in the power supply. The performance only changes a little or not if you do good filtering.
