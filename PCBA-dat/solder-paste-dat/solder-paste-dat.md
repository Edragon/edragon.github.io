## Low temperature soldering paste

Low temperature soldering paste is a type of solder paste designed to melt and flow at lower temperatures than standard solder pastes. Here are its main features:

- Melting Point: Typically melts between 130°C and 180°C, compared to standard lead-free solder pastes which melt around 217°C.
- Composition: Often contains bismuth-based alloys (e.g., Sn42/Bi58) instead of traditional tin-silver-copper (SAC) alloys.
- Applications: Ideal for temperature-sensitive components, rework, or double-sided PCB assembly where high heat could dam-Age parts.
- Reduced Thermal Stress: Minimizes risk of warping or dam-Aging PCBs and components.
- Energy Saving: Lower reflow oven temperatures reduce energy consumption.
- Compatibility: Useful for mixed-technology boards or assemblies with plastic connectors and LEDs.
