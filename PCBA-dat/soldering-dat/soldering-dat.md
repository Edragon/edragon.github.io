T113 soldering note: 务必先焊接除T113以外的元器件，烧录51单片机固件，按下面的说明，测量3.3V、1.5V、0.9V全部正常再焊T113，否则若EA3036的FB虚焊将会直接烧坏T113。

T113 soldering note (English): Be sure to solder all components except T113 first, program the 51 MCU firmware, and follow the instructions below to measure 3.3V, 1.5V, and 0.9V to ensure they are all normal before soldering T113. Otherwise, if the FB pin of EA3036 is poorly soldered, T113 may be directly damaged.



### FPC soldering

### alternative temperature-sensitive items soldering


> No special solder paste is needed; the key point is not to heat the FPC connector directly—apply heat from the back side of the PCB.
> 
> **Explanation:**
> When soldering temperature-sensitive components like FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) connectors, you generally do not need to use any special type of solder paste. The most important thing is to avoid applying hot air or direct heat to the FPC connector itself, as it can be easily damaged by high temperatures. 
> Instead, use a hot air gun or soldering tool to heat the solder joints from the back side of the PCB. This approach helps protect the delicate connector and ensures a reliable solder joint.
