## AA Battery Leakage After Long-Term Disuse

### Professional Term:
- **Electrolyte leakage**
- **Battery leakage**
- More technically: **Battery electrolyte leakage due to self-discharge and chemical decomposition**

### Causes:
- **Zinc corrosion** over time
- **Gas buildup** inside the battery
- **Seal failure**, leading to leakage
- **Chemical degradation** of the battery's internal components

### Common Leakage Substance:
- **Potassium hydroxide** (from alkaline batteries)
  - A caustic and corrosive substance that can damage electronics and surfaces

### Notes:
- Most common in **alkaline** and **zinc-carbon** AA batteries
- Happens especially when batteries are **stored unused for extended periods**

### Prevention Tips:
- Remove batteries from unused devices
- Store batteries in a cool, dry place
- Use newer batteries with better sealing technology
