## **18650 vs. 21700 Batteries**
| **Model** | **Size**   | **Energy Density** | **Common Uses**                 |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **18650** | 18 √ó 65 mm | 2000 ‚Äì 3500mAh     | Laptops, EVs, tools             |
| **21700** | 21 √ó 70 mm | 4000 ‚Äì 5000mAh     | Tesla batteries, energy storage |

Tesla originally used **18650 batteries** in **Model S/X** but later switched to **21700** for **Model 3/Y** and is now moving towards **4680** cells for higher efficiency.


The 18650 battery should fall under the Lithium-ion Battery category, as it is a specific form factor of the lithium-ion battery, commonly used in applications such as laptops, power tools, flashlights, and electric vehicles.

## safety concern 

After 30 years of development, the preparation process of 18650 battery has been very mature. In addition to the great improvement in performance, its safety is also perfect. 

To prevent the metal casing from exploding, the battery is now fitted with a safety valve at the top. The safety valve is now a standard part of every 18650 Li-ion battery and is the most important barrier. When the pressure inside the cell becomes too high, the top safety valve opens to vent and depressurize, preventing an explosion. 

However, when the safety valve is open, chemicals leaking from inside the battery can react with oxygen in the air at high temperatures and still cause a fire. 

In addition, most 18650 batteries now also come with their own protection panel with overcharge and overdischarge and short circuit protection, which has high safety performance.

## CID safety 

The CID (Current Interrupt Device) in an 18650 battery is a safety feature designed to prevent overheating and potential hazards. If the internal pressure of the battery gets too high (usually due to overcharging or overheating), the CID disconnects the circuit, stopping the current flow to prevent a dangerous situation, such as thermal runaway or explosion.

Each manufacturer might have slightly different specifications, but the CID is a common safety component in lithium-ion batteries, especially in high-capacity cells like the 18650.

### üîí What is CID Safety for 18650 Batteries?

#### What is CID?

- **CID** stands for **Current Interrupt Device**.
- It is a **built-in safety mechanism** inside many 18650 lithium-ion cells.
- Designed to **prevent dangerous overpressure and overheating**.

---

#### How Does CID Work?

- The CID is a **pressure-sensitive switch** inside the cell.
- When internal gas pressure rises above a certain threshold (due to:
  - Overcharging,
  - Short circuit,
  - Thermal runaway),
  
  the CID **disconnects the internal current path**.
- This **interrupts current flow**, effectively stopping the battery from further charging or discharging.
- It **helps prevent cell rupture, fire, or explosion**.

---

#### Why Is CID Important?

- Lithium-ion cells generate gas if damaged or overcharged.
- Pressure build-up can cause catastrophic failure.
- CID acts as a **last-resort safety valve** inside the cell.
- It **works alongside external protection circuits and BMS**.

#### Summary Table

| Feature               | Description                                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose               | Prevent overpressure and overheating            |
| Mechanism             | Pressure-activated internal switch               |
| Activation Threshold  | Specific pressure level inside the cell          |
| Effect                | Interrupts internal circuit to stop current flow |
| Role                  | Safety backup inside individual 18650 cells     |

---

#### Important Notes

- CID **does not reset** after activation; cell is permanently disabled.
- Cells with CID still **require external protection** (BMS).
- Not all lithium cells have CID ‚Äî mostly found in high-quality 18650s.
