## li-battery tech 

### Low Battery Voltage (Below Safe Threshold)

Protection boards are designed to protect lithium batteries from over-discharge, overcharge, and short circuits. Many lithium battery protection circuits cut off the battery's output if the voltage drops below a certain threshold, often around 2.5V to 2.8V.

If the battery is at **2.6V**, it's very close to this cutoff threshold, and the protection circuit may be designed to prevent any further discharge to avoid damaging the battery, which could explain the drop to 0V.

Smaller types (e.g., 14500): Used in compact or AA-sized electronics.




## üîå Notes on Battery Chemistry

Most of these are Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) or Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO‚ÇÑ):

Li-ion: Higher energy density, common in consumer electronics.

LiFePO‚ÇÑ: Lower energy density, but longer cycle life and more stable ‚Äî often used in solar and industrial applications.

## üîí Protected vs Unprotected

Protected cells: Include a small circuit to prevent overcharge, overdischarge, and short-circuit.
