An **active battery balancing board** for lithium batteries ensures that all cells in a battery pack maintain the same voltage level during charging and discharging. It actively redistributes energy between cells, transferring charge from higher-voltage cells to lower-voltage ones. This helps:

- **Improve Battery Life**: Prevents overcharging or over-discharging of individual cells, reducing wear and extending the overall lifespan of the battery pack.
- **Enhance Performance**: Ensures consistent voltage across cells, improving the efficiency and reliability of the battery.
- **Increase Safety**: Reduces the risk of overheating, overcharging, or cell failure due to imbalances.
- **Optimize Capacity**: Maximizes the usable capacity of the battery pack by ensuring all cells are equally charged.

This is especially important in applications like electric vehicles, power tools, and energy storage systems.
