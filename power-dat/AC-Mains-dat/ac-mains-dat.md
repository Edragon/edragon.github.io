## Note 

- The live wire of domestic circuits is usually red and is at high voltage. 
- The neutral wire is black and has voltage close to that of the ground. 
- The potential difference between these two wires in India is about 220 V. 
- The earth or ground wire provides safety against faults and current leaks. 
- Earth pin is longer to ensure earth connection happens first while connecting and last while disconnecting any devices. 


## 1. What is AC (Alternating Current)?
- **AC (Alternating Current)** is the type of electricity commonly used in homes and buildings.
- The voltage **alternates direction** (50 or 60 times per second — 50Hz or 60Hz).
- It powers appliances, lights, outlets, etc.

## 2. The Three Main Wires in an AC Circuit

### 🔴 Live (Hot) Wire
- **Carries voltage** from the power source (e.g., 120V or 220V).
- **Dangerous** – touching it can result in electric shock.
- **Color**: Often **black** or **brown** (varies by country).

### 🔵 Neutral Wire
- **Returns current** back to the power source to complete the circuit.
- **Usually near 0V**, but can still be hazardous.
- **Color**: Often **white** or **blue**.

### 🟢 Ground (Earth) Wire
- **Safety wire**, doesn't carry current under normal conditions.
- **Connected to the earth** – redirects electricity safely during a fault.
- **Color**: Usually **green** or **green/yellow striped**.

## 3. How They Work Together (Water Analogy)

| Water System      | Electrical System         |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Water source      | 🔴 Live wire (carries power) |
| Drain pipe        | 🔵 Neutral wire (returns current) |
| Overflow pipe     | 🟢 Ground wire (emergency path) |

---

## ⚠️ Safety Notes
- Only **Live** wire carries full voltage.
- **Neutral** may still be dangerous if wiring is faulty.
- **Ground** is for safety and **should not be live**.
- **Never touch wires** unless the power is off and you are trained.

---

✅ Use a multimeter to test wiring safely, and always follow local electrical codes and safety standards.
