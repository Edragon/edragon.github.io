A Li-ion cell showing **0 V** usually means something seriously wrong.  
Two main causes:

---

## 1. **Protection Circuit Tripped** (Only for “protected 18650”)
Some 18650 cells include a tiny PCB at the bottom.  
If the cell is over-discharged, the protection board **disconnects** the output → terminal voltage reads nearly **0 V**.

- Internal cell voltage is usually still **1–2 V**, not truly 0 V.
- Only applies if your cell is a **protected** 18650.

---

## 2. **Cell Is Internally Damaged** (Most common)
A fully unprotected or old 18650 can reach 0 V if:

- Severe over-discharge  
- Internal chemical breakdown  
- Internal short circuit  
- Copper plating inside  
- Safety vent (pressure valve) triggered

If the safety vent opens, the cell is **permanently unsafe**.

**True 0 V = the cell is dead.**

# ⚠️ Can You “Fix” a 0 V 18650?
**No. Not safely.**  
Trying to recharge a 0 V Li-ion can cause:

- Fire  
- Venting hot gas  
- Explosion  
- Thermal runaway  

Even trained engineers only attempt recovery in fireproof labs.

**For home use:  
0 V = NOT repairable.**

---

# ✔️ What You Should Do
- Do **NOT** charge it.  
- Do **NOT** heat, hammer, or puncture it.  
- Recycle it at an **e-waste / battery recycling point**.

This is the only safe option.
