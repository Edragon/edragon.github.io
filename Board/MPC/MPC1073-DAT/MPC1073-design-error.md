Blue mark: the wrong vias are on the trace, which cause the error
Green mark: cut the trace on the right green mark first, then add fly wire like this.

* We made different version of the board based on different kinds of the footprint, because of the raising price of the chips. Otherwise we have to raise the price of this board dramatically. Thank you.
