## note - Oxidation

When exposed to external pollution or exposed to the air for a long time, the white silver layer and metal substrate of the buzzer are prone to oxidation problems such as yellowing and blackening of the surface. This is a normal phenomenon and will not affect the electrical performance of the product!
