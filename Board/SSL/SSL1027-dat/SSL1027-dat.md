## Pin Configuration

* GND - GND
* VCC - VCC, 3-12V, DC, use 5V directly is fine
* OUT - output, when detect certain frequency output TTL low
* FIN - Identifier frequency input, this can input the frequency for identifying, be aware the amplification should lower 0.2V
* FOUT - Identifier frequency output pin, this pin output the identifying frequency which is set
* ROUT - Amplifier real time output pin, detect audio amplifier signal real time output.

## Note: 
* make sure VCC and GND is not reverse
* Use adjust resistor, make sure the indicating LED off and then start to use, since there is noise in the environment, so you have to set the noise to a small frequency area.
