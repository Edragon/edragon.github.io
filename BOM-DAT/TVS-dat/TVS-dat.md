## SMBJ5.0A

Recommended SMBJ Model:
For 5V systems, the SMBJ5.0A (or SMBJ5.0CA for bidirectional protection) is a suitable choice.

Key Parameters of SMBJ5.0A:
- Reverse Stand-off Voltage (𝑉𝑅𝑊𝑀V​ ): 5.0V
- Breakdown Voltage: 6.40V to 7.07V
- Clamping Voltage: 9.2V (this is the maximum voltage the TVS diode will clamp to during a surge)
- Peak Pulse Current: Can handle high current surges (typically in the range of 43.5A).

Why Choose SMBJ5.0A:
- It has a reverse standoff voltage of 5V, meaning it will not conduct under normal operating conditions of your 5V system.
- It will clamp the voltage to 9.2V during overvoltage events, protecting your circuit from damage.
- If your system is exposed to electrostatic discharge (ESD) or power surges, this diode will absorb the excess energy.
- Alternative:
- If you need bidirectional protection (e.g., for AC signals or where polarity can reverse), the SMBJ5.0CA (the bidirectional version) offers the same protection levels but in both polarities.

Conclusion:
- For protecting a 5V voltage line, SMBJ5.0A (unidirectional) or SMBJ5.0CA (bidirectional) would be the best choice, ensuring your 5V system is safeguarded from voltage spikes and surges.
