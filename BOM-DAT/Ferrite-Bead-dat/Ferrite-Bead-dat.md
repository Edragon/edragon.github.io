Ferrite Bead

Nature: A passive component made of ferrite material, usually without a noticeable winding structure.

Function: Mainly used for high-frequency noise suppression, acting as a frequency-dependent resistor that provides high impedance at high frequencies to absorb noise.

Applications:

- Power Decoupling: Reducing power supply noise (e.g., in DC-DC converters).
- Signal Integrity: Used in high-speed signal transmission lines (e.g., USB, HDMI).
- EMI Suppression: Minimizing electromagnetic interference.
