# IRFR1205 LED Strip Dimming When Gate is Low ‚Äî Full Analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem
Your IRFR1205-controlled LED strip **dims slightly even when the gate is low (TTL level)**.  
That means the MOSFET is **not fully turning off** ‚Äî it‚Äôs still leaking or partially conducting.

---

## üîç Likely Causes

| Cause | Explanation |
|--------|--------------|
| **1. Gate not truly at 0V** | MCU pin might be floating, or not configured as output-low. |
| **2. Gate resistor too large (1kŒ©)** | Gate discharges slowly through 1k + 10k pull-down ‚Üí MOSFET remains half-on for milliseconds. |
| **3. Wrong wiring (high-side N-MOSFET)** | If you placed MOSFET between +12V and LED, the body diode or floating source will let current through. |
| **4. Not a true logic-level MOSFET** | IRFR1205 needs ~10V for full off/on. At 5V logic, partial conduction occurs. |
| **5. Ground not shared** | If MCU and LED power supply grounds aren‚Äôt common, gate never reaches 0V relative to source. |
| **6. Slow switching** | Long RC constant causes the MOSFET to stay in linear region during PWM transitions, visible as dimming. |

## ‚öóÔ∏è Quick Tests

1. **Short gate to ground**
   - Connect gate directly to GND (remove 1k temporarily).  
   - ‚úÖ If dimming stops ‚Üí gate drive is too weak or slow.

2. **Measure voltages**
   - Measure **Vgs = Vgate ‚àí Vsource** when ‚Äúoff‚Äù.  
   - It must be **< 0.3V** for full off.  
   - If Vgs = 0.5‚Äì1V ‚Üí partial conduction.

3. **Ensure pin is output-low**
   - MCU pin should be actively set LOW (push-pull mode), not input or open-drain.

4. **Check wiring**
   - Correct low-side wiring:  
     ```
     +12V ‚îÄ LED +  
            LED ‚àí ‚îÄ Drain (IRFR1205)  
     Source ‚îÄ GND  
     MCU GND ‚îÄ same GND
     ```
   - If you connected it high-side, flip it as above.

## üîß Fixes

| Fix | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Reduce gate resistor** | Change **1kŒ© ‚Üí 47Œ©‚Äì100Œ©**. Speeds up discharge and ensures full turn-off. |
| **Keep 10k pull-down** | Keeps gate at 0V when MCU pin is floating. |
| **Drive gate strongly low** | Set MCU pin mode to ‚Äúoutput‚Äù and write LOW. |
| **Check power wiring** | Ensure common ground between MCU and 12V LED supply. |
| **Use correct switch side** | IRFR1205 should be **low-side** switch only (drain to LED‚àí, source to GND). |
| **Use better MOSFET for 5V logic** | Replace with a true logic-level FET (e.g. **IRLZ44N**, **AOZ1284**, **AO3400**, **AOD4184A**). |
| **Use gate driver if needed** | For high current or PWM, use a driver that outputs 10‚Äì12V gate voltage. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Test Results (Typical)

| Condition | Gate Resistor | Dimming | Cause |
|------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| 1kŒ© + 10k pull-down | Yes | Gate discharges too slowly |
| 100Œ© + 10k pull-down | No | Fast edge, full off |
| Gate tied directly to GND | No | Confirms slow discharge or drive issue |
| 5V logic drive, high current load | Slight dim | MOSFET not fully enhanced |
| 10V gate drive | None | Fully enhanced and fast off |

## ‚úÖ Recommended Setup

```
+12V ‚îÄ LED strip +
LED strip ‚àí ‚îÄ Drain
Source ‚îÄ GND
MCU pin ‚îÄ‚îÄ100Œ©‚îÄ‚îÄ Gate
Gate ‚îÄ‚îÄ10k‚îÄ‚îÄ GND
(MCU and 12V share ground)
```


Optional:
- Add **flyback diode** if LED strip has inductive components.
- Add **small 100nF cap** across LED for smoother PWM fading.

## üß† Conclusion

Your LED dimming when the gate is low means:
- The gate isn‚Äôt discharging fully or fast enough.  
- The IRFR1205 isn‚Äôt fully off at 5V logic.  

**Solutions:**  
‚Üí Lower gate resistor to **47‚Äì100Œ©**,  
‚Üí Ensure gate goes to **0V**,  
‚Üí Use a **logic-level MOSFET** or **10V gate driver** if current is high.
