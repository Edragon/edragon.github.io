TC4451/TC4452 == 12A High-Speed MOSFET Drivers

The TC4451/TC4452 are single-output MOSFET drivers. These devices are high-current buffers/drivers capable of driving large MOSFETs and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). The TC4451/TC4452 have matched output rise and fall times, as well as matched leading and falling-edge propagation delay times. The TC4451/TC4452 devices also have very low crossconduction current, reducing the overall power dissipation of the device.
