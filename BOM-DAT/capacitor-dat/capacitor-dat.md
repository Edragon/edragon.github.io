## Specs 

The 3-Character Capacitor Code
The three-character code with the letter-number-letter format is used for capacitors with Class 2 and Class 3 dielectrics. C0G is a Class 1 dielectric, so it’s not included (more on this later). X5R and X7R are in Class 2, and Y5V is in Class 3.

- The first character indicates the lowest temperature that the capacitor can handle. The letter X (as in X7R, X5R) corresponds to –55°C.
- The second character indicates the maximum temperature. The theoretical range is from 45°C to 200°C; 5 (as in X5R) corresponds to 85°C, and 7 (as in X7R) corresponds to 125°C.
- The third character indicates the maximum amount of capacitance change over the part’s temperature range. The spec for --R capacitors (such as X5R and X7R) is ±15%. The capacitance of parts with a code ending in V can actually decrease by as much as 82%! This probably explains why Y5V capacitors are not so popular.
