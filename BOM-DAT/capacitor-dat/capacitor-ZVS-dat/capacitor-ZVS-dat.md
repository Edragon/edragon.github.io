# capacitor-ZVS-dat

**ZVS** stands for **Zero Voltage Switching**, a technique used in power electronics to reduce switching losses and electromagnetic noise.

A **ZVS capacitor** (sometimes called a **resonant capacitor** or **tank capacitor**) is a **high-frequency, high-current film capacitor** used in ZVS circuits ‚Äî especially in **induction heaters**, **resonant converters**, and **DC‚ÄìDC inverters**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Function

In a ZVS circuit:
1. The **inductor (L)** and **capacitor (C)** form an **LC resonant tank**.
2. The capacitor‚Äôs charge/discharge creates a **sinusoidal voltage waveform**.
3. MOSFETs or IGBTs switch **only when the voltage across them is near zero**, minimizing losses.

The ZVS capacitor:
- Stores and releases energy during switching cycles.  
- Ensures **phase alignment** between voltage and current for resonance.  
- Allows **soft switching**, reducing heat and EMI.

## üß© Typical Parameters

| Parameter                              | Typical Range            | Notes                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Capacitance**                        | 0.1 ¬µF ‚Äì 5 ¬µF            | Depends on frequency and power level |
| **Voltage rating**                     | 400 V ‚Äì 2000 V DC        | Must handle resonant voltage peaks   |
| **Type**                               | Polypropylene film (MKP) | Low ESR, low ESL, high pulse current |
| **ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance)** | Very low (<0.01 Œ©)       | Essential for low heating            |
| **Current handling**                   | 10‚Äì100+ A (RMS)          | Must survive continuous AC ripple    |

## ‚ö° Why It Matters

ZVS capacitors enable:
- **High-efficiency** power conversion (90‚Äì98%)
- **Cooler MOSFETs**
- **Quiet operation** (less ringing)
- **Longer component life**

Without a proper ZVS capacitor:
- Switching occurs with high voltage still present
- MOSFETs overheat or fail
- Resonance breaks down

## üìò Typical Uses

| Application              | Example                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Induction heater driver  | LC tank capacitor         |
| Tesla coil / ZVS flyback | Energy transfer capacitor |
| Resonant converter       | Resonant link capacitor   |
| Class-E amplifier        | Output matching capacitor |

## üßÆ Example

In a 100 kHz ZVS induction heater:
```
L = 5 ¬µH
C = 1 ¬µF
f = 1 / (2œÄ‚àö(LC)) = ~71 kHz
```
The capacitor and coil oscillate at the resonant frequency, letting the MOSFETs switch right when voltage ‚âà 0 V ‚Üí **Zero Voltage Switching**.
