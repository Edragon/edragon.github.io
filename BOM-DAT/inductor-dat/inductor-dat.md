## Choke

"Choke" in electronics typically refers to an inductor, not a ferrite bead. However, its function may be similar to that of a ferrite bead. Hereâ€™s the key difference:

1. Choke = Inductor
   
Nature: A type of inductor, usually consisting of a wound coil, with a core made of air, ferrite, or other magnetic materials.

Function: Primarily used for filtering, blocking high-frequency AC signals while allowing low-frequency or DC signals to pass.

Applications:

- Common Mode Choke: Used in EMI filtering to reduce common-mode noise (such as interference on power lines).
- Differential Mode Choke: Used in power circuits for filtering and improving power quality.
- Power Line Chokes: Used in power systems to suppress harmonics in the grid.
