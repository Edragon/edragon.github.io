The **JST SM series** is a common wire-to-wire connector, often used in LED strips, RC electronics, and low-current applications.

## Key Specifications

- **Series**: JST SM  
- **Type**: Wire-to-wire, single row, housing + crimp terminal  
- **Pitch (pin spacing)**: **2.50 mm** (not 2.54 mm)  
- **Current rating**: ~3 A (per pin, typical)  
- **Voltage rating**: ~250 V AC/DC  
- **Number of positions**: 2–12 pins available  
- **Locking mechanism**: Positive latch (prevents accidental disconnect)  
- **Wire gauge**: AWG 22–28 (stranded wires, typical)  
- **Mating cycles**: ~30 times (not a high-durability connector)  

## Important Note

- Many vendors (especially on marketplaces) mislabel it as **“2.54 mm”**, but **the official JST specification is 2.50 mm pitch**.  
- Since 2.50 mm ≈ 2.54 mm, people often confuse them, but they are **not guaranteed cross-compatible** with other 2.54 mm systems (like Dupont, KK254).

## Summary

- **Correct spec**: **JST SM 2.50 mm pitch**  
- “JST SM 2.54” is just a common mislabeling.
