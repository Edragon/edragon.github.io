## S8050 NPN Transistor Truth Table

| Base (B) | Collector (C) | Emitter (E) | Transistor State | Collector-Emitter Current |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:------------------------:|
|   LOW    |     HIGH      |    LOW      |    OFF (Cutoff)  |           0              |
|   HIGH   |     HIGH      |    LOW      |   ON (Saturation)|        Flows (ON)        |

**Notes:**
- **Base HIGH**: A small current applied to the base (typically >0.7V above emitter) turns the transistor ON, allowing current to flow from collector to emitter.
- **Base LOW**: No base current keeps the transistor OFF, and no current flows from collector to emitter.
- **Collector is usually connected to a positive voltage, emitter to ground.**
