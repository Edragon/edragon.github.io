FLL177ME == L-Band Medium & High Power GaAs FET

The FLL177ME is a Power GaAs FET that is specifically designed to provide high power at L-Band frequencies with gain, linearity and efficiency superior to that of silicon devices. The performance in multitone environments for Class AB operation make them ideally suited for base station applications. This device is assembled in hermetic metal/ceramic package.
