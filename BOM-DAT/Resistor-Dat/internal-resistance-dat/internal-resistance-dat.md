## New 12V Lead-Acid Scooter Battery - Internal Resistance

- **SLA / AGM / Gel battery (12V, 7–12Ah typical for scooters)**  
- **Internal Resistance:** ~20–50 milliohms (0.02–0.05 Ω) per cell  
- **Total battery (6 cells in series, 12V nominal):** ~0.12–0.3 Ω  

### Notes:
- Lower internal resistance = better ability to deliver high current (important for starting scooters).  
- Resistance increases with battery age, sulfation, or poor charge.  
- Measurement: typically done with a **micro-ohmmeter** or a battery internal resistance tester at low current (~1–5A).


## Normal 18650 Battery Internal Resistance

- **Typical Nominal Voltage:** 3.6–3.7V  
- **Capacity:** 2000–3500 mAh  
- **Internal Resistance (Fresh, New):**
  - Standard Li-ion (e.g., Panasonic NCR, LG, Samsung): ~30–80 milliohms (0.03–0.08 Ω)
  - High-drain Li-ion (e.g., for power tools, e-cigarettes): ~15–30 milliohms (0.015–0.03 Ω)

### Notes:
- Lower internal resistance → higher possible discharge current  
- Internal resistance increases with:
  - Battery aging
  - High temperature or deep cycling
  - Poor storage conditions
- Measured at room temperature (~20–25°C) and at low AC or DC test current

⚡ Summary:

A healthy new 18650 battery typically has 0.03–0.08 Ω internal resistance, with high-drain versions as low as 0.015–0.03 Ω.
