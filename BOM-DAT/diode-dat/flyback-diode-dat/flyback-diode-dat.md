### üîå Purpose in Motor Driver Circuits

#### 1. üõ°Ô∏è Flyback (Freewheeling) Diode

**Motor coils are inductive.** When you suddenly switch off current, the collapsing magnetic field generates a **high voltage spike** (back-EMF) in the opposite direction.

üîÅ The MBRF20100 provides a **safe path** for this current to flow:
- Prevents **voltage spikes**
- Protects **MOSFETs / BJTs / ICs**
- Helps motor **coast down smoothly** rather than abruptly stop

> Usually placed **in parallel with the motor or across switching MOSFETs**, with reverse polarity.

#### 2. üîÑ Freewheeling Path in H-Bridge

In an H-Bridge or half-bridge circuit:
- When one MOSFET turns off, the inductor (motor winding) forces current to keep flowing.
- MBRF20100 acts as a **freewheeling diode**, conducting the residual current until it dissipates.

This helps:
- Reduce switching losses
- Avoid voltage spikes
- Improve efficiency

### 3. ‚ö° Reverse Polarity Protection

Sometimes used as a **reverse polarity protection diode** at the power input stage:
- Blocks current if polarity is reversed
- Protects the entire driver circuit

But note: This isn‚Äôt its most common role ‚Äî it's more often used for **inductive load handling**.

### ‚úÖ Why MBRF20100 Specifically?

- **20A / 100V** rating suits many medium/high-power motors
- **Schottky type** ‚Üí fast switching, low forward voltage drop
- **High efficiency** (less heat vs. regular diodes)
- **TO-220** package ‚Üí easy to heatsink for high current use

### üìê Schematic Snippet (Freewheeling Example)

```
 V+ ---+
       |
      [Motor]
       |
      +++---+
      |     |
     GND   [MBRF20100]
             | |
             +-+
             |
            GND
```

- The MBRF20100 is in reverse-bias across the motor
- When the motor coil releases energy, the diode **conducts** to safely dissipate it
