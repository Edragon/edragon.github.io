A Zener diode is a special type of diode designed to reliably allow current to flow "backwards" (in the reverse-biased direction) when a specific set reverse voltage, known as the Zener voltage, is reached.

Its primary application is to provide a stable reference voltage. When reverse-biased at or above its Zener voltage, it maintains a nearly constant voltage across its terminals, even if the current through it varies. This makes it useful for voltage regulation and protection circuits.
