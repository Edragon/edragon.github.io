OV2710 is a high-end CMOS Sensor dedicated to 1080P video recording. 

It has a size of 1/2.7 and a wide frame of 16:9. 

It can provide high-quality video at a resolution of 1920X1080 at 30 frames per second, with good low-light performance and a high dynamic range. 

It is suitable for applications such as security cameras, drones, and other high-definition video recording applications.


Since the full frame of OV2710 is 16:9, only 16:9 resolutions (1920x1080 and 1280x720) can achieve a large angle. 

For other 4:3 resolutions, the picture is cropped and the angle is smaller.
