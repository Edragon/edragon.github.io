## Features 

- Single channel continuous drive current 1.2A
- Single channel maximum peak current 3.2A
- Input power supply range 5.5-15V
- Protection functions: **short circuit protection, over-temperature protection**
- Other functions: power supply voltage sampling, encoder interface
- Control signal pins: to control one motor's forward and reverse rotation, 1 PWM channel and 2 general IOs are needed
- Logic or reference power supply range: no logic power supply needed, reference voltage uses the built-in regulated 5V output
- Function: can simultaneously drive 4 motors for forward/reverse rotation with stepless speed regulation, **PWM dead zone is much smaller than L298N**
