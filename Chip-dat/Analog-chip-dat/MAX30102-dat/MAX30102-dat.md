The MAX30102 is an integrated pulse oximeter and heart rate monitor biosensor module. It integrates a red LED and an infrared LED, photodetector, optical components, and low-noise electronic circuitry with ambient light suppression. 

The MAX30102 features a 1.8V power supply and a separate 5.OV power supply for internal LEDs. 

It is used in wearable devices for heart rate and blood oxygen acquisition, and is worn on fingers, earlobes, and wrists. 

The standard 12C-compatible communication interface can transmit the collected values ​​to the Arduino, KL25Z and other microcontrollers for heart rate and blood oxygen calculation. 

In addition, the chip can also shut down the module through software, the standby current is close to zero, and the power supply is always maintained. 

Because of its excellent performance, the chip is widely used in the Samsung Gala x y S series mobile phones. Compared with the previous generation MAX30100, the chip integrates a glass cover to effectively eliminate external and internal light interference, and has the best reliable performance.
