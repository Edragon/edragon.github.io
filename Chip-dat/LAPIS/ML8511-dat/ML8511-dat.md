## module info 

The ML8511 breakout is an easy to use ultraviolet light sensor. The MP8511 UV (ultraviolet) Sensor works by outputing an analog signal in relation to the amount of UV light that’s detected. This breakout can be very handy in creating devices that warn the user of sunburn or detect the UV index as it relates to weather conditions.

This sensor detects 280-390nm light most effectively. 

This is categorized as part of the UVB (burning rays) spectrum and most of the UVA (tanning rays) spectrum. It outputs a analog voltage that is linearly related to the measured UV intensity (mW/cm2). If your microcontroller can do an analog to digital signal conversion then you can detect the level of UV!

OKI (OKI) to launch the built-in operational amplifier ultraviolet (UV) sensor IC – ML8511. The products use coated silicon (SOI) on the insulating -CMOS, the company’s first analog voltage output, no filter UV sensors.

OKI’s UV sensor IC due to the easily highly integrated SOI-CMOS technology, suitable for digital and analog circuits. OKI, said the company’s future will utilize this expertise, enhanced with digital output circuit connected to the microprocessor, and then type the sensed brightness control sensor (Ambient Light Sensor) constitute a single chip product lineup.

Hope not only to future products be done on the day the amount of UV at a glance, and at any time to grasp the degree of risk decorative UV measurement equipment, and will promote the application to appliances, portable equipment in the field.

ML8511 with UV light analog voltage output proportional to the amount. Since the output voltage can therefore directly connected to the MCU built A / D digital / analog converter, no photoelectric converting circuit. And the use of small, thin package surface, suitable for use in portable devices.
