High stability digital MEMS gyro

Low ARW, high accuracy and high repeatability MEMS gyroscope

High precision ± 300 °/s closed-loop MEMS gyroscope with digital interface


GYPRO®4300 is a miniature, tactical-grade, low ARW and low drift digital MEMS gyroscope that offers a cost-effective alternative to entry-level Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (FOG) and Dynamically Tuned Gyroscopes (DTG) at a fraction of their size, weight, and power consumption.

It features a ± 300 °/s input measurement range, 200 Hz bandwidth and 1 ms latency with a closed-loop architecture that ensures high linearity and stability in dynamic environments.
