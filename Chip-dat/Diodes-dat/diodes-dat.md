The AP22652, AP22653, AP22652A, and AP22653A are singlechannel, precision-adjustable, current-limited switches optimized for applications that require precision current limiting, or to provide up to 2.1A of continuous load current during heavy loads/short circuits. 

These devices offer a programmable current-limit threshold between 125mA and 2665mA (typ) via an external resistor. Current-limit accuracy Â±10% can be achieved at high current-limit settings. The rise and fall times are controlled to minimize current surges during turn on/off.
