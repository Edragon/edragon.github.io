MAX31328 == ±3.5ppm, I2C RTC with Integrated Crystal and Power Management

The MAX31328 is a low-cost, extremely accurate, I2C real-time clock (RTC) with an integrated temperaturecompensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal. The device incorporates a battery input and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power to the device is interrupted. The integration of the crystal resonator enhances the long-term accuracy of the device and eliminates the external crystal requirement in the system. The MAX31328 is available in a 10-pin LGA package.
