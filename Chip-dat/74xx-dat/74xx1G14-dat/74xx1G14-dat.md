The MC74VHC1G14DFT1G is a single inverting Schmitt trigger manufactured by ON Semiconductor. It is part of the VHC (Very High-Speed CMOS) family and is designed for high-speed and low-power applications.

An inverting Schmitt trigger is a type of digital circuit that converts an input signal with noise or slow transitions into a clean, sharp digital output. It is "inverting" because the output signal is the logical opposite (inverted) of the input signal.

Inverting Operation:

The output is inverted compared to the input:
- When the input voltage exceeds the upper threshold, the output switches to LOW.
- When the input voltage drops below the lower threshold, the output switches to HIGH.
