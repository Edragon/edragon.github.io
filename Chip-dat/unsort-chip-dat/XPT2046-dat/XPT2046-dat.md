Key Features
- Resistive Touch: Detects touch by pressing two layers together, working with fingers or styluses.
- 4-Wire Interface: Uses four wires (X+, X-, Y+, Y-) for voltage division and reading coordinates.
- 12-bit ADC: A 12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter samples touch points at 125 kHz.
- SPI Communication: Connects to microcontrollers (like Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) via SPI for data transfer.
- Interrupt (IRQ) Pin: Signals when the screen is pressed (low) and released (high).
- Low Voltage Operation: Works with supply voltages as low as 2.2V.
