CPC5902G-I2C

CPC5902 Optically Isolated I2 C Bus Repeater

IXYS Integrated Circuits’ CPC5902 is a dual, optically isolated, bidirectional logic-bus repeater. It galvanically isolates two open-drain logic signals, and provides a galvanic isolation of 3750Vrms. When the two sides’ supply voltages are configured with different voltages, the CPC5902 also functions as a logic level translator for levels as low as 2.7V or as high as 5.5V.
