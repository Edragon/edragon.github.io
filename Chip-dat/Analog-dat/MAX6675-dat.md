# MAX6675-dat 


The MAX6675 is a temperature module that uses a K-type thermocouple to measure temperatures from 0°C to 1024°C. It includes a driver and amplifier. The MAX6675 digitizes the signal from the thermocouple and outputs the data in a 12-bit resolution, SPI-compatible, read-only format. 


The MAX6675 has the following features: 
- 0°C to 1024°C temperature range
- 12-bit resolution
- SPI-compatible, read-only format
- 0.25°C temperature resolution
- 8 LSBs thermocouple accuracy for temperatures ranging from 0°C to +700°C
- Small-outline IC, narrow (0.15in)
- Requires a power source from 3.0V to 5V
- Draws 1.5mA maximum


The MAX6675 is discontinued and replaced with the MAX31855.
