## Brief 

Introduction of A3967:

A3967slb US allegro produced by pwm constant current control micro-step drive two-phase stepper motor dedicated driver. 

Its working voltage up to 30v, the drive current of 750ma, a a3967slb to drive a two-phase stepper motor can achieve 8 segments driven.

Pwm chip inside the current control circuit can be added to the pfd voltage is set to slow, fast, mixing three current decay mode, if the voltage is higher than pfd end 0.6vdd, select the slow decay mode. If less than 0.21vdd, select fast decay mode. Between the two in mixed decay modes. 

In addition, a3967slb can provide comprehensive protection measures, including transient voltage suppression, thermal protection, to prevent pass-through current, under voltage lock function.

No additional a3967slb between the microprocessor and other interface circuits, the chip usingÂ easystepper
interface, decreased control lines from 8 to 2 (step and direction), simply by entering the stepper motor control pulse, its embedded converter can be achieved on stepper motor control.

a3967slb also need some resistors, capacitors to adjust its operating parameters, the entire drive circuit is very simple
