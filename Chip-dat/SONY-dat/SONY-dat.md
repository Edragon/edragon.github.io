#### High-Resolution (3280x2464) Imaging

With an 8MP resolution (3280x2464), this Raspberry Pi 5 camera module delivers sharp, detailed images, ensuring high-quality output for both static and dynamic content. The 79.3° field of view guarantees comprehensive capture without distortion, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including security cameras and visual inspections.

#### How to Choose IMX219-77-4Lane camera module

The IMX219-77-4Lane camera module is available in two versions: 

79° FOV (this one) and 120° FOV. The 79° FOV version offers a narrower, more focused field of view, making it ideal for applications requiring precision and detail, such as industrial automation, object recognition, and close-range inspections. 

The 120° FOV wide-angle version, designed for broader area capture, is perfect for security surveillance, smart home monitoring, autonomous robots, and large-scale visual inspections. Its wider field of view allows for fewer cameras to cover larger spaces, reducing blind spots in monitoring systems.
