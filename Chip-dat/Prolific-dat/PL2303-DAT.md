## brief 
This is a newly designed product, with a prolific production company PL2303TA Taiwan chip, PL2303TA provides a full-duplex asynchronous serial RS232-like device to connect to any Universal Serial Bus (USB) host can be a convenient solution. PL2303TA perfectly compatible win XP / VISTA / 7/8 / 8.1 system can be simulated in most operating systems allow existing applications based on COM ports can be easily ported and USB connectivity, and COM port without rewriting the software Application of the traditional COM port.

By using USB bulk transfer mode, the advantages of large data buffers and automatic flow control, PL2303TA can achieve higher throughput compared to conventional UART required (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) true RS232 signal transmission rate higher than 115200 point can be used for even higher performance. PL2303TA flexible baud rate generator can be programmed to produce any rate 75 basis points and 6 million base points.

PL2303TA is designed for use in mobile and embedded solutions, provides a compact, can be easily adapted to any connectors and handheld devices. With a very small business or Suspend mode power consumption, PL2303TA is perfect with plenty of power left for the equipment connected to the bus-powered operation.
