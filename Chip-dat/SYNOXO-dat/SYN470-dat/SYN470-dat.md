# SYN470 RF Transmitter Chip

The SYN470 is a single-chip RF (Radio Frequency) transmitter IC manufactured by Synoxo (now part of RFIC Solutions).

## Key Features

**Frequency Range:**
- Operates in the 433MHz ISM band (typically 433.05-434.79MHz)
- Some variants support other sub-GHz frequencies

**Modulation:**
- ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)
- OOK (On-Off Keying) 
- FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) capabilities

**Power Supply:**
- Low voltage operation (typically 2.1V to 3.6V)
- Low power consumption for battery-operated devices

## Common Applications

- **Remote Controls** - Garage doors, car alarms, toys
- **Wireless Sensors** - Temperature, humidity, security sensors
- **Home Automation** - Light switches, smart home devices
- **Industrial Telemetry** - Short-range data transmission

## Technical Specifications

- **Output Power:** Typically up to +10dBm
- **Data Rate:** Usually up to 10kbps
- **Package:** Small form factor (often SOT-23 or similar)
- **Interface:** Simple serial data input

## Advantages

- Very cost-effective solution
- Simple implementation - minimal external components
- Good for short-range, low-data-rate applications
- Low power consumption extends battery life

The SYN470 is popular in consumer electronics where cost is critical and high-performance RF isn't required. It's often paired with corresponding receiver chips like SYN480 series for complete wireless communication solutions.
