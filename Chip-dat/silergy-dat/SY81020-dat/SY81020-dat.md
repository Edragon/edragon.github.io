The SY81020 is available in a compact QFN3x4 package.

The stable internal reference (VREF) provides ±1% accuracy over TJ= -40°C to 125°C, and the differential input sense configuration allows the feedback sensing at the most relevant load point.

The SY81020 is a high-efficiency synchronous step-down DC-DC regulator featuring internal power and synchronous rectifier switches capable of delivering 20A of continuous output current over a wide input voltage range, from as low as 2.9V up to 16V. The output voltage is adjustable from 0.6V to 5.5V.

Internal 7.5mΩ power and 2.4mΩ synchronous rectifier switches provide excellent efficiency for a wide range of applications, especially for low output voltages and low duty cycles. Cycle-by-cycle current limit, input under-voltage lock-out, internal soft-start, output under- and over-voltage protection, and thermal shutdown provide safe operation in all operating conditions.

Silergy’s proprietary Instant-PWM™ fast-response, constant-on-time (COT) PWM control method supports high input/output voltage ratios (low duty cycles) and responds to load transients within ~100ns while maintaining a near-constant operating frequency over line, load and output voltage ranges. This control method provides stable operation without complex compensation, even with low ESR ceramic output capacitors.
