### ✅ Why DRV8871 Is Suitable for Gear DC Motors

| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Voltage Range**        | 6.5V to 45V — supports most DC gear motors                                  |
| **Current Capability**   | 3.6A continuous, 6A peak — suitable for medium-to-high torque gear motors    |
| **PWM Control**          | Supports PWM input — lets you control speed effectively                     |
| **Built-in Protection**  | Overcurrent, undervoltage, thermal shutdown, and shoot-through protection   |
| **Brushed DC Motor**     | Designed for brushed DC motors, which includes most gear motors             |

### ⚠️ Things to Check Before Using

1. **Motor Voltage**: Must be within 6.5V–45V.
2. **Motor Current**: Peak current should not exceed 6A.
3. **Heatsinking**: May be required for high current loads to prevent overheating.

---

### 🛠 Example Use Case

- A **12V gear motor** drawing **1–2A average** and **<6A peak** is **ideal** for DRV8871.
- Great for applications like:
  - Robot arms
  - Mobile platforms
  - Mechanisms with high starting torque

- ILIM == pin4 == Connect a resistor to ground to set the current chopping threshold

For example, if R_ILIM = 32 kΩ, the DRV8871 device limits motor current to 2 A no matter how much load torque is applied. 

The minimum allowed RILIM is 15 kΩ.
