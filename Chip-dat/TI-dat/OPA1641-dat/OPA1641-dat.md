# OPA1641-dat

The OPA1641 is a rail-to-rail output, low-noise JFET-input op-amp that can operate with both single and dual power supplies.

Power Supply Range:
- Single-supply operation: +4.5V to +36V
- Dual-supply operation: ±2.25V to ±18V


This flexibility allows the OPA1641 to be used in both single-supply (e.g., 5V, 12V, 24V) and dual-supply (e.g., ±5V, ±15V) applications.
