### About MPU-6000

MPU-6000 is the world’s first integrated 6-axis motion processing components, compared to the multi-component program, it eliminats the problem of poor combination of the gyroscope and accelerometer axis, reduces the amount of packaging space. MPU-6000 integrated 3-axis gyroscope, three-axis accelerometer, and containing by second I2C port to connect to other brands of accelerators, magnetic sensors, or other sensors of digital motion processing (DMP: Digital Motion Processor) hardware acceleration engine I2C port in the form of a single data stream, output to the application side complete 9-axis fusion algorithm technology

InvenSense’s motion processing database can handle the complexity of the motion sensing data, reduced motion processing operations load the operating system, and application development architecture of the API.

The angular velocity of the MPU-6000 grid sensing range is ± 250, ± 500, ± 1000 and ± 2000 ° / sec (dps), can be accurately chase Zong fast and slow action, and the user can program-controlled accelerator grid sense The measurement range of ± 2g, ± 4g ± 8g and ± 16g. Product transmission by up to 400kHz I2C or up to 20MHz SPI.

MPU-6000 can operate at different voltages VDD supply voltage referral 2.5V ± 5%, 3.0V ± 5% or 3.3V ± 5%, logical interface VVDIO supply of 1.8V ± 5%. MPU-6000 package size 4x4x0.9mm (QFN), is revolutionary in the industry size. Other features include built-in temperature sensor, oscillator contains only ± 1% in the operating environment changes.
