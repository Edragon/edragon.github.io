`ICM-20948` == World's Lowest-Power 9‑Axis MEMS MotionTracking® Device

The ICM-20948 is the world’s lowest power 9-axis MotionTracking device that is ideally suited for Smartphones, Tablets, Wearable Sensors, and IoT applications. It combines a 3‑axis gyroscope, 3‑axis accelerometer, 3‑axis compass, and a Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP™) in a 3 × 3 × 1 mm (24‑pin QFN) package, with only one third of the power that other 9‑axis devices‑need.

`ICM-20602` == The ICM-20602 is a 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, in a small 3 × 3 × 0.75 mm (16-pin LGA) package.


`ICM-20689` == The ICM-20689 is a 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, in a small 4 × 4 × 0.9 mm (24-pin QFN) package.
