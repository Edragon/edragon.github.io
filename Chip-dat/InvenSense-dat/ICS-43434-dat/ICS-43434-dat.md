Multi-Mode	Microphone	with	I2S	Digital	Output


The ICS-43434 is digital I2S output bottom port microphone. 

The complete ICS-43434 solution consists of a MEMS sensor, signal conditioning, an analog-to-digital converter, decimation and antialiasing filters, power management, and an industry standard 24-bit I²S interface. 

The I²S interface allows the ICS-43434 to connect directly to digital processors, such as DSPs and microcontrollers, without the need for an audio codec in the system.

The ICS-43434 has multiple modes of operation: High Performance, Low Power (AlwaysOn) and Sleep. 

The ICS-43434 has high SNR and 120 dB SPL AOP in all operational modes.

The ICS-43434 has a high SNR of 65 dBA and a wideband frequency response. The sensitivity tolerance of the ICS-43434 is ±1 dB, which enables high-performance microphone arrays without the need for system calibration.

The ICS-43434 is available in a small 3.50 mm × 2.65 mm × 0.98 mm surface-mount package. The ICS-43434 is function-compatible with the ICS-43432 while providing equivalent electro-acoustic performance at lower power consumption and in a smaller package.
