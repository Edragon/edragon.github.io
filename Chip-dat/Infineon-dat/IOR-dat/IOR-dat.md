Series PVG612 & PbF

Microelectronic Power IC HEXFET® Power MOSFET Photovoltaic Relay Single Pole, Normally Open, 0-60V, 1.0AAC/ 2.0 A DC


The PVG612 Series Photovoltaic Relay is a singlepole, normally open solid-state relay that can replace electromechanical relays in many applications. 

It utilizes International Rectifier’s proprietary HEXFET power MOSFET as the output switch, driven by an integrated circuit photovoltaic generator of novel construction. 

The output switch is controlled by radiation from a GaAlAs light emitting diode (LED) which is optically isolated from the photovoltaic generator.
