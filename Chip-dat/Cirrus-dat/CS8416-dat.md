192 kHz Digital Audio Receiver

The CS8416 is a digital audio receiver that supports sample rates up to 192 kHz. It enables consumer and professional audio products to exchange S/PDIF and AES/EBU audio data. An 8:2 input multiplexer allows for up to eight channels of digital audio input data. The second output of the input multiplexer allows for a S/PDIF pass-through function for added system flexibility. It has an extremely low-jitter clock-recovery mechanism that yields a very clean recovered clock from the incoming audio stream. The device also allows for selectable signal routing to three general-purpose output pins. With its extremely low-jitter performance of 200 ps, the CS8416 is an industry-leading 192 kHz digital audio receiver. The CS8416 is ideal for consumer and professional applications such as audio/video receivers, multimedia speakers, digital mixing consoles, automotive audio systems and set-top boxes.
