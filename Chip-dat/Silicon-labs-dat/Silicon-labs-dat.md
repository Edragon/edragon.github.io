[SI4455 - EASY-TO-USE, LOW-CURRENT OOK/(G)FSK SUB-GHZ TRANSCEIVER](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si4455.pdf)

Silicon Laboratories’ Si4455 is an easy-to-use, low current, sub-GHz EZRadio® transceiver. Covering all major bands, it combines plug-and-play simplicity with the flexibility needed to handle a wide variety of applications. The compact 3x3 mm package size combined with a low external BOM count makes the Si4455 both space efficient and cost effective. The +13 dBm output power and excellent sensitivity of –116 dBm allows for a longer operating range, while the low current consumption of 18 mA TX (at 10 dBm), 10 mA RX, and 50 nA standby, provides for superior battery life. By fully integrating all components from the antenna to the GPIO or SPI interface to the MCU, the Si4455 makes realizing this performance in an application easy. Design simplicity is further exemplified in the Wireless Development Suite (WDS) user interface module. This configuration module provides simplified programming options for a broad range of applications in an easy to use format that results in both a faster and lower risk development. The Si4455 is capable of supporting major worldwide regulatory standards such as FCC, ETSI, ARIB and China regulatory standards.
