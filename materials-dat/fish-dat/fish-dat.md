## Fish Abundance by Sea Depth

Fish numbers and species vary significantly with ocean depth. Here’s a general distribution:

---

### 1. **Shallow Coastal Waters (0–50 meters)**
- Plenty of sunlight, relatively warm water, and high oxygen levels.
- Seaweeds, corals, and plankton are abundant, providing lots of food.
- **Fish abundance is the highest**, with diverse species, such as:
  - Small edible fish (sardines, anchovies)
  - Reef fish (clownfish, surgeonfish)
  - Predatory fish (bass, grouper)

---

### 2. **Midwater Zone (50–200 meters)**
- Light diminishes, fewer phytoplankton, slightly cooler water.
- Fish numbers remain moderate, but species diversity is lower than shallow waters.
- Common fish:
  - Sardines, mackerels, young tunas
  - Medium-sized predatory fish

---

### 3. **Deep Sea Zone (Below 200 meters)**
- Almost no light, high pressure, very low temperature.
- **Fish numbers drop significantly**, mostly species adapted to deep sea.
- Common fish:
  - Lanternfish, anglerfish
  - Deep-sea sharks, gulper eels

---

### ✅ Summary
- **Fish are most abundant at 0–50 meters**, especially near coasts, reefs, and estuaries.
