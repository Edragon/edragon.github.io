### Metal Soldering

Context: standard soldering iron (~300–400°C) + tin-based solder.

Summary: Copper-based metals are the easiest to solder with a regular iron. Aluminum is difficult without special methods. If you need to make a hard-to-solder metal solderable, plating (tin or copper) is an effective approach.

Quick reference — which metals can be soldered with a regular iron:
- Very easy (standard soldering): Copper and high-copper alloys (brass, red copper, tin-plated copper).

Why copper alloys are best for soldering:
1. Oxide film is easy to break down with flux.
2. Tin wets copper extremely well.
3. Copper and tin form Cu–Sn intermetallics → a true metallurgical bond.

Practical suggestion: To make almost any metal solderable
- First plate with tin or copper (methods):
  - Chemical plating
  - Electroplating
  - Solder spray / tin coating

Useful tips
- Use appropriate flux for the base metal.
- Ensure mechanical cleaning (brushing/sanding) before soldering when possible.
- For aluminum, use special fluxes and/or aluminum-specific solders or plate the joint first.

## Metal Dust — Control at the Source

Best strategy: reduce dust generation at the cutting stage.

Recommended cutting methods (from least to most dust):
| Cutting method        | Dust amount | Notes |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Cold saw / band saw   | ⭐ lowest   | Produces chips/strips rather than fine dust |
| Hand saw (hacksaw)    | ⭐⭐ low     | Low airborne dust; slower |
| Angle grinder cutting | ❌ high     | High speed creates fine powder |
| Cutting wheel / abrasive | ❌❌ very high | Produces fine dust and sparks; worst for airborne particles |

Practical controls
- Prefer sawing with coolant or low-speed blade when possible.
- Use local exhaust ventilation and masks for abrasive cutting.
- Wet cutting or vacuum extraction reduces airborne dust.

## Cutting: Ease, Tool Wear, and Chips

| Material         | Relative Cutting Ease | Tool Wear | Dust / Chips Produced    | Heat Generation | Notes |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ----- |
| Aluminum alloy   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very easy)     | Low       | Chips (few fine dust)    | Low–Medium      | Soft; can clog blades at high RPM |
| Brass (黄铜)     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (Easy)          | Low–Medium| Clean chips              | Medium          | Free-cutting; stable |
| Copper (紫铜)    | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (Medium)        | Medium    | Long, sticky chips       | Medium–High     | Ductile; tends to smear |
| Stainless steel  | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (Hard)          | High      | Fine chips + dust        | High            | Work-hardens; use low speed and coolant |

Notes
- Match blade type and speed to material.
- Use coolant for steels and stainless to reduce heat and tool wear.
- Control chip evacuation to prevent blade clogging.

## Metal Adhesives (Glue)

Key steps to get a strong bond—more important than the adhesive brand:

1. Surface preparation — sanding (required)
   - Aluminum alloys: use 400–600 grit sandpaper.
   - Stainless steel: also sand to remove oxide and increase surface roughness.
   - Purpose: remove oxide layer and increase mechanical keying.

2. Degrease (required)
   - Use isopropyl alcohol or acetone.
   - Wipe thoroughly and let dry.

3. Control adhesive layer thickness
   - Recommended thickness: 0.1–0.3 mm
   - Too thin → lower strength; too thick → more brittle

4. Clamp during curing
   - Clamp for alignment and pressure, but do not squeeze all adhesive out.
   - Ensure even contact and correct gap thickness.

General adhesive notes
- Choose an adhesive suitable for the material and environment (temperature, load, chemical exposure).
- For metals, epoxy and structural acrylics are common choices.
