## Heat-Dissipation

Thermal Conductivity

| Material                | Thermal Conductivity (W/m·K)    | Notes                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Air (ambient)           | ~0.025                          | Very low; air gaps between component and heatsink greatly reduce heat transfer |
| Regular Silicone Grease | ~0.2–0.3                        | About 8–12× better than air; mostly for gap filling, electrically insulating   |
| Thermal Silicone Grease | ~1–8 (depending on filler type) | Metal or ceramic-filled paste; much better heat conduction than air            |


## water-resistant

- [[waterproof-dat]]

**Silicone grease** is a common material used to make electrical and mechanical connections water-resistant.

## 1. Properties of Silicone Grease

- **Hydrophobic** – repels water, does not dissolve in water  
- **Non-conductive** – safe for electrical connections  
- **Temperature resistant** – works from very low to high temperatures  
- **Lubricating** – prevents wear and makes assembly easier  
- **Chemical resistant** – stable, does not react with most plastics or metals

## 2. How It Works for Waterproofing

1. **Seals gaps**: Fills tiny spaces between threads, O-rings, or connectors, preventing water ingress.  
2. **Protects against corrosion**: Prevents moisture from reaching metal surfaces.  
3. **Maintains flexibility**: Unlike adhesives or tapes, it stays soft and allows movement without breaking the seal.

## 3. Common Uses

- Electrical connectors in outdoor devices (LEDs, RC vehicles, marine electronics)  
- O-rings on pumps or valves  
- Battery terminals exposed to moisture  
- Sealing connectors on cameras, sensors, or drones

## 4. Advantages Over Other Sealants

| Feature              | Silicone Grease | Rubber/O-ring Only            | Epoxy / Sealant         |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Waterproof           | Excellent       | Good if O-ring fits perfectly | Excellent but permanent |
| Reusable             | Yes             | Yes                           | No                      |
| Safe for electronics | Yes             | Yes                           | No (may trap heat)      |
| Easy to apply        | Very easy       | Moderate                      | Hard / permanent        |
