✅ Much safer ways to cut 4 mm plastic sheet

These are tools that are far safer for teens to use:

1) Utility knife + score & snap

For ABS / acrylic → clean and fast.
(Just score many times along a ruler, then snap.)

2) Hand saw (fine tooth)

Like a small hacksaw → slow but safe.

3) Jigsaw (with adult supervision)

Use a fine-tooth blade → works well for curves and straight cuts.

4) Small circular cutter for plastic

If you have a hobby cutter or mini saw, they usually work safely.
