PA66: This stands for Polyamide 66, which is a type of nylon. It's a common engineering thermoplastic known for its high mechanical strength, rigidity, and excellent resistance to heat and chemicals. It's often used to make durable enclosures for electronics, some of which are designed to be waterproof.

✅ Much safer ways to cut 4 mm plastic sheet

These are tools that are far safer for teens to use:

1) Utility knife + score & snap

For ABS / acrylic → clean and fast.
(Just score many times along a ruler, then snap.)

2) Hand saw (fine tooth)

Like a small hacksaw → slow but safe.

3) Jigsaw (with adult supervision)

Use a fine-tooth blade → works well for curves and straight cuts.

4) Small circular cutter for plastic

If you have a hobby cutter or mini saw, they usually work safely.
