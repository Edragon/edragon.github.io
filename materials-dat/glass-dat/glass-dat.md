## Float High-Definition Glass

**Difference from Ordinary Glass**: Compared to ordinary glass, float high-definition glass requires higher purity of raw materials and stricter process control during production. The final product has significantly improved visual effects and physical properties.

**Safety**: Although float glass itself is relatively strong, it is often further treated with tempering or lamination to enhance safety. Tempered glass shatters into small, less harmful pieces, while laminated glass does not scatter even when broken.

"Float high-definition glass" usually refers to ordinary annealed float glass.

Annealed float glass is a brittle material: any scratches, edge processing, adhesive joints, or microcracks can greatly reduce its load-bearing capacity. Compared to curved (cylindrical/spherical) structures, flat panels are more prone to bending and forming tensile stress, and ultimately, breakage often occurs suddenly without obvious plastic deformation.

## Drilling

**Required Tools**

- Diamond hollow drill bit (10 mm)
- Electric drill (preferably variable speed, do not use hammer mode)
- A wooden board (prepared)
- Water (continuous cooling)
- Clamps / tape (to fix the glass)
- Rubber ring or small dam (to keep a water pool)

**✅ Step-by-Step Guide**

1) **Fix the Glass to Prevent Vibration**

Vibration is the main cause of glass breakage.

- Place the glass on a wooden board.
- Tape the four corners and edges with clear tape.
- Ideally, use two clamps to gently secure it (do not overtighten).

2) **Drill at Low Speed (Critical Step)**

- Drill speed: 300–800 rpm (the slower, the better).
- Never use high speed or hammer mode.

Reason: High speed causes instant heating → thermal expansion and contraction → immediate shattering.

3) **Start Drilling with the "Angled Scoring Method"**

This prevents the drill bit from wandering and chipping the edge.

- Begin with the drill bit tilted at 15–20°.
- Gently grind a small semicircular groove.
- Once the groove is formed, slowly straighten the drill bit.

This step greatly increases the success rate.

4) **Keep Water Cooling Throughout (Essential)**

The drill bit and drilling area must always be covered with water.

You can use:

- Clear tape + a ring of clay/plastic to make a "small pool"
- Or have someone continuously spray water

Water cooling reduces the risk of breakage by over 70%.

5) **Grind Down Slowly, Do Not Apply Force**

Drilling glass relies on "grinding," not "pressing."

- Keep hand pressure to a minimum.
- Let the drill bit grind down slowly on its own.
- Pause every few seconds.

6) **Be Extra Gentle Near Breakthrough**

The last 1/4 of the thickness is most prone to shattering.

Method:

- Be extremely gentle towards the end.
- The wooden board should be tight against the glass.
- It's best to tape the back of the glass.

This helps prevent chipping.

**🧪 Tips for Success**

- Use a hollow drill bit (ten times better than a solid one).
- Use the lowest speed on the drill.
- Never dry grind, and don't rush.
- If it's tempered glass → no method can drill it (it will shatter completely).
