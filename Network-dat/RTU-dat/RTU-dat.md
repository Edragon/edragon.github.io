A **Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)** is a microprocessor-controlled electronic device that interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system by transmitting telemetry data to a master system, and by using messages from the master supervisory system to control connected objects.

Key functions and characteristics of an RTU include:

*   **Data Acquisition:** Reading analog and digital inputs from sensors and field devices (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow, status of a switch).
*   **Control Output:** Sending digital and analog output signals to control actuators (e.g., opening/closing a valve, starting/stopping a motor).
*   **Communication:** Communicating with a central master station (often a SCADA master or a Distributed Control System - DCS) using various communication protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3, IEC 60870-5-101/104) over different media (radio, cellular, satellite, wired networks).
*   **Local Intelligence:** Modern RTUs often have processing capabilities to perform local control logic, data logging, and alarming, even if communication with the master station is lost.
*   **Ruggedness:** Designed to operate in harsh environmental conditions often found in industrial settings (e.g., wide temperature ranges, humidity, vibrations).
*   **Autonomy:** Can operate autonomously for periods based on pre-programmed instructions.

**Common Applications:**
RTUs are widely used in various industries for remote monitoring and control, such as:

*   **Oil and Gas:** Monitoring pipelines, wellheads, and remote facilities.
*   **Water and Wastewater:** Managing pumping stations, reservoirs, and treatment plants.
*   **Electric Utilities:** Monitoring substations, reclosers, and distribution networks.
*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Collecting data from remote sensor stations.
*   **Transportation:** Monitoring traffic signals and railway systems.

In essence, an RTU acts as a bridge between the physical equipment in the field and the central supervisory control system.
