### UHF
UHF is a range of radio waves which allows a radio or television receiver to produce a good quality of sound. UHF is an abbreviation for 'ultra-high frequency'.


Ultra high frequency (UHF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies in the range between 300 megahertz (MHz) and 3 gigahertz (GHz), also known as the decimetre band as the wavelengths range from one meter to one tenth of a meter (one decimeter). 

Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the super-high frequency (SHF) or microwave frequency range. 

Lower frequency signals fall into the VHF (very high frequency) or lower bands. 


### DMR Radio 

Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) is a digital radio standard that allows for two-way radios to work together on the same network. 

The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) created DMR in 2005. DMR equipment works between 30 MHz and 1000 MHz, with two categories of frequencies:
- Very High Frequency (VHF): 30 MHz to 300 MHz
- Ultra High Frequency (UHF): 300 MHz to 1 GHz

DMR is a TDMA mode (Time Division Multiple Access) that allows multiple users to share a frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. DMR can cover distances ranging from a few hundred meters in indoor settings to several kilometers in outdoor environments. 

When buying a DMR radio, you can consider things like: Battery life, Power output, Range, License. 

Programming DMR radios can be complex, so it may be helpful to get sample codeplugs from a local club to get started.
