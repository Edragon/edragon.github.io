## ðŸ”¹ Will Message
- A special message defined by the client when it connects.
- Published **by the broker** if the client disconnects unexpectedly (without sending a proper `DISCONNECT`).
- Example: `"Device123 offline"`

## ðŸ”¹ Will Topic
- The MQTT topic where the broker will publish the **will message**.
- Other clients subscribed to this topic will receive the notification.



## MQTT QoS (Quality of Service)

In MQTT, **QoS (Quality of Service)** defines the **guarantee level of message delivery** between a publisher and a subscriber.  
There are **3 levels**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ QoS 0 â€” "At most once"
- **Meaning**: The message is delivered **at most once**, best effort, no acknowledgment.
- If the client or broker goes offline during transmission, the message may be lost.
- **Use case**: Non-critical data, such as sensor readings that update frequently.

---

### ðŸ”¹ QoS 1 â€” "At least once"
- **Meaning**: The message is delivered **at least once**.  
- Broker requires acknowledgment (`PUBACK`).
- Duplicates may occur (subscriber could get the same message more than once).
- **Use case**: Important data that must arrive, but duplicates are acceptable (e.g., logging, notifications).

---

### ðŸ”¹ QoS 2 â€” "Exactly once"
- **Meaning**: The message is delivered **exactly once**.  
- Uses a 4-step handshake (`PUBREC`, `PUBREL`, `PUBCOMP`).
- No duplicates, no missing messages.  
- Highest reliability but more overhead (slower and heavier).
- **Use case**: Billing systems, financial transactions, or critical commands.

## MQTT broker on ubuntu 

install service and check status 

    sudo apt install -y mosquitto

    sudo systemctl status mosquitto

more systemctl check 

- Stop the mosquitto service:
    - $ sudo systemctl stop mosquitto
- Start the mosquitto service:
    - $ sudo systemctl start mosquitto
- Restart the mosquitto service:
    - $ sudo systemctl restart mosquitto

Log file 

    cat /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log

## Conf Setup list

Secure the Mosquitto Server

Create a default.conf under the directory.

    nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf

    allow_anonymous false  // not allow anonymous
    password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd // set password

optionally 

    listener 1883  // set port 1883 public, or listener 1883 localhost for localhost only
    listener 1884 // set 1884 for wss protocol websockets

set users 

    nano /etc/mosquitto/passwd

    electrodragon:electrodragon

Restart the mosquitto service to load the new changes.

    sudo systemctl restart mosquitto


## MQTT client 

    sudo apt install -y mosquitto-clients

sub:

    mosquitto_sub -t "test"
    mosquitto_sub -u electrodragon -P electrodragon -t "test"

pub:

    mosquitto_pub -m "ON" -t "test"

A number of my IoT students make use of (the FREE plan with) BeeBotte for their remote MQTT broker.

https://beebotte.com/

It's very easy to set up and works really well with Nod-RED.

## execute 

From this point forward, you should execute any pub/sub command using the syntax below. Remember to replace electrodragon and EXAMPLE_PASSWORD with the credentials that you defined in the password file.

    mosquitto_sub -u electrodragon -P electrodragon -t "home/lights/sitting_room"
    mosquitto_pub -u electrodragon -P electrodragon -t "home/lights/sitting_room" -m "ON"
