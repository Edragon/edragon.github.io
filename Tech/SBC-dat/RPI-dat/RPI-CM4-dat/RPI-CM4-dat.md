The Raspberry Pi Compute Module is a small, powerful, and customizable single-board computer designed for embedded applications. It is based on the same architecture as the Raspberry Pi boards but in a more compact form factor. The Compute Module provides a more flexible and modular approach compared to the standard Raspberry Pi boards.

Here are some key features of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module:

- Broadcom BCM2835 processor with ARM Cortex-A7 CPU
- 512MB/1GB RAM options
- 4GB eMMC flash memory (optional)
- 200-pin SODIMM connector for easy integration
- HDMI and USB interfaces via breakout board
- Camera and display interfaces
- Support for industrial temperature range (-20°C to +70°C)
- Support for various operating systems, including Linux and Windows 10 IoT Core
