## Knowledge

The control of the steering gear generally requires a time base pulse of about 20ms. The high level part of the pulse is generally the angle control pulse part in the range of 0.5ms-2.5ms, and the total interval is 2ms.
Taking the 180-degree angle servo as an example, the corresponding control relationship is as follows:

- 0.5ms------------  0 degrees;
- 1.0ms------------  45 degrees;
- 1.5ms------------  90 degrees;
- 2.0ms------------  135 degrees;
- 2.5ms------------  180 degrees;
