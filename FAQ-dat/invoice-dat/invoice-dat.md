Dear customer,

We are a small company running an automated online store, we only support online store payment.Â 

You can find shipping costs and options while online checkout. 

If you need a proforma invoice, you can hold the payment (hold on the last step while checkout and keep it as a pending order). I will email you it later as a PDF.

If you just need an invoice afterward, you can place the order directly, and download the invoice later from your account page. 

Thank you. Best Regards
